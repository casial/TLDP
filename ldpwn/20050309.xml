<listitem><para>Coert wrote a Secure Internet for Small Office / Home Office
HOWTO.  A draft version of the document is available at
http://www.cybcon.com/~coert/linux/siso/index.html.  The HOWTO describes how to
bring up your own Firewall, Wireless Access Point and VPN Server on a single
board computer.  It currently uses the Geode SC1100 and Atheros WiFi NIC, but
could easily be extended to include other hardware, drivers and services.

<listitem><para>lists@mjhall.org proposed to write a Computational Linguistics
HOWTO.  This HOWTO would briefly survey the major branches of contemporary
computational linguistics and the major types of linguistics software, and then
catalogue Linux software available in each category. An extensive bibliography
and list of resources such as websites and mailing lists would also included.
Some general advice would also be offered on system configuration for
linguistics work.  Martin Wheeler and Rahul Sundaram were excited about the
idea. </para></listitem>

<para>Modifiability of documentation and software</para>

<para>In a discussion thread concerning modifiability of documentation and
data, Rahul Sundaram commented that most people don't care about whether the
source code is modifiable but that, that doesn't mean we say we don't care about
Free or open source software.  David Lawyer responded indicating that there is
a difference between software and documents.  David said <quote>Software needs
to be free since it's relatively hard to write it and much of it is reusable.
But for documentation, the situation is a lot different.  I've looked at a few
of our old documents that are out-of-date and they mostly need to be entirely
rewritten.  This can be done even if the doc doesn't allow modification.  Why?
Because one uses the info in the obsolete doc plus information in other docs to
write a new doc.  Facts are not copyrighted.</quote>  David was in favour of
modifiable documents, but not as strongly as Rahul was.  An interesting
discussion ensued.  </para>
