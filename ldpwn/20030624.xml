<title>We need volunteers!</title>
<para>That's about the conclusion of last week's 
<ulink url="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:4627:200306:chccignifbnihoieigoj">major thread</ulink> 
on the discuss mailing list.  In an ever-changing environment, our documents 
become outdated tremendously fast: a one year old HOWTO is like pre-historic 
charcoal writing on stone.  Apart from people with a technical background, we 
also need user reviews to check on a document's usability.  Not only will user 
comments improve on readability; if more people read a HOWTO and comment on it, 
it would be easier to make out which are just hype and which are useful for the 
general public, as <ulink url="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:4616:200306:chccignifbnihoieigoj">David Lawyer pointed out</ulink> 
in the discussion.</para>

<para>While on the subject, several means of getting more volunteers were 
discussed.  It was generally agreed that neither mailing the LUGS about every 
review needed, nor advertising this in Slashdot would improve greatly on the 
current situation.  Indeed, one can hardly be forced to be a volunteer.</para>

<para>So let's just apply to your goodwill: make your skills known to us - even 
if your only skill is that you speak English, and 
<ulink url="http://tldp.org/mailinfo.html#maillists">join the LDP</ulink>!  In 
my (Tille's) point of view, even if you can only do a little bit, you owe it to 
the community, for being able to use such a good system. Joining the discuss 
mailing list <email>discuss-subscribe@en.tldp.org.NOSPAM</email> would be a good start.  We look forward to hearing from you soon!

<para>Several governments, among which the European, can now subsidize your work
for TLDP.  Check with your local representative.</para>
</note>
<para>As a side-effect, copyright laws came up in this lengthy discussion.  Of course there's the law: in almost any country all writing is copyright, on any medium, and you need the author's permission to do anything with it.  But since most authors are rather flattered to be quoted, remember that getting approval can be arranged in a convivial style.</para>
