<para>Modifiability of Documents</para>

<para>Rahul Sundaram wanted to include "modifiability of documents as a
licensing requirement" in the LDP manifesto and also <ulink
url="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:8594:200503:ihpahginmljdgbhooeje">suggested</ulink>
modifying the authors guide.  This led to a discussion on licensing and various
licenses available for documentation.  Emma Jane Hogbin <ulink
url="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:8711:200503:jklinmkmkkeoaokicenh">posted</ulink>
changes to the authors guide and asked for suggestions and comments.  The
thread petered out and went on to discuss how Debian handles documentation and
Emma <ulink
url="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:9003:200503:jklinmkmkkeoaokicenh">sent
a mail</ulink> to the maintainers to the doc-linux and doc-linux-nonfree Debian
packages requesting a "a succinct explanation on the distinction so that they
[TLDP authors] may choose the best license for their document".  </para>

<para>Proposed LDP Organization: Subject Specialists</para>

<para>David Lawyer <ulink
url="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:9127:200503:claiepedajakajhoajgg">proposed</ulink>
that The LDP partition the existing and expected future LDP docs into say 20-40
categories and find a subject specialist for each category. <quote>She would
first review all the docs on this subject.  If docs were not being adequately
maintained, she would try to find new authors.  She would also try to find
authors for areas covered by the subject but not adequately by any LDP docs.
She would suggest mergers or splits in exiting documents.  New doc proposals
would go the the appropriate subject specialist.</quote>  He said that there
should be a subject specialist coordinator and <quote>the subject specialist
coordinator would need to have good knowledge of all aspects of Linux and have
time to check out the facts when disputes arose.  The subject specialist
coordinator and assistants would initially have to find people to do reviews
for cases where there was no subject specialist to do it.  The subject
specialist coordinator might keep a list of people willing to do technical
reviews</quote>.   People in general thought that this would be a good idea and
went on to discuss it further.  </para>
