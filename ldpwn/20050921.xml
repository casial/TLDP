<para>Machtelt Garrels <ulink

to know</ulink> which distributions included the LDP documents and
called for volunteers to contact distributions that don't include them
and follow it up with a discussion.  Greg Ferguson indicated that he
talked to a RedHat individual who worked on the docs package and was
told that it took a fair bit of work to package the HOWTOs in a
reasonably sane way and they had limited space on CD.  The RedHat 7.3
errata said that <quote>Several complaints were received concerning the
correctness of the LDP documentation as well as the difference in
procedures between the LDP documentation and the official Red Hat Linux
documentation. Thus, it was decided to no longer provide the LDP
documentation on the Documentation CD</quote> </para>

<para>Among the popular Linux distributions, Debian, SUSE, Slackware and
Ubuntu seem to include the LDP document collection.</para>
