<listitem><para>The <ulink url="http://www.julieandian.com/writing/82howto/">DB2 8.2 HOWTO</ulink> by Ian Hakes is ready for a first review.  There is also a <ulink url="http://www.julieandian.com/writing/82howto/db2LinuxHowToV8_definitive_5.pdf">pdf version of this DB2 8.2 HOWTO</ulink> available.  Ian says:  This HOWTO is intended for anyone interested in installing and using DB2 UDB on Linux. The information found in this document is based on the experience I had as an information developer at IBM installing and configuring DB2 UDB Version 8.2 on Red Hat 8 and SuSE Pro 8 (DB2 supports way more distributions, and I hope to include more information on these distributions in the future). </para></listitem>

<para>Mirror sites:</para>

<para>Mehmet Ackin set up the first (official) mirror for Puerto Rico; it is located at <ulink url="http://ldp.cnnet.upr.edu" />.</para>
<para>Paul Kaiser has one in Romeoville, Illinois, US, at <ulink url="http://linux.cs.lewisu.edu/tldp/" />.</para>
<para>John Buswell informs us about connectivity problems with the <ulink url="http://ldp.splicednetworks.com">Athens, Ohio</ulink> mirror, because of a move they have done.  Presumably, the problems will be resolved by the second half of next month.  Meanwhile, maybe it is best to switch to another <ulink url="http://tldp.org/mirrors.html#usa">Ohio mirror</ulink> to be sure you are reading the latest versions of our documents.</para>
<para>Thrassivoulos Kalantzis informed us about a change in the URL of his mirror, update your bookmarks to use <ulink url="http://ldp.gr-linux.net/" /> instead of <ulink url="http://www.gr-linux.net/LDP" />.</para>
