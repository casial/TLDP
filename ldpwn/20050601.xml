<para>The LDP tool prototyping</para>

<para>Stein Gjoen silently hacks away at tools that are useful for The
LDP.  Where there may not be a lot of buzz about the same, much of
Stein's TLDP work is located at his home page <ulink
url="http://www.nyx.net/~sgjoen/tarpl.html" />.  Stein indicated that
the web correlator script is now on line and (somewhat) documented, but
not very user friendly.  The program is about 150 lines of AWK script,
takes in apache logs and creates a HTML report.  These reports can be
huge both in terms of size on paper as well as number of bytes.  Sample
is about 180 KB.  </para>

database runs on is going off-line soon for a few weeks for a re-vamp,
and he hasn't had the time to transfer it to another machine for the
interim.  </para>

<para>HOWTOs in Debian Sarge</para>

<para>Now that Debian has entered freeze and is on the verge of release,
Stein Gjoen was wondering which documents from TLDP will be included and
how recent these are.  Rick Moen replied pointing Stein to <ulink
url="http://packages.debian.org/testing/doc/doc-linux-text" />, <ulink
url="http://packages.debian.org/testing/doc/doc-linux-html" /> and
<ulink url="http://packages.qa.debian.org/d/doc-linux.html" />.  Frank
Lichtenheld, the Debian package maintainer for the HOWTOs added that he
doesn't plan any further updates until the release since only a few
HOWTOs have been changed since the last one, but that can change if the
release gets delayed or there are many HOWTO updates in the next few
days.  Andrew M.A. Cater on the thread indicated the non-free status of
GNU Free Documentation License for Debian.  </para>
