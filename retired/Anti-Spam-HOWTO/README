Welcome to the Anti-Spam-HOWTO!


"The Anti-Spam-Howto" is still in the formative stage. Soon we will have an
outline, and then content will start to be added. In the spirit of open source
projects, anyone is welcome to participate.

The document itself will be in Docbook XML format and be located in a CVS
repository at the Linux Documentation Project http://www.tldp.org/. The
project files can be viewed with a web browser at: 

 http://cvsview.tldp.org/index.cgi/LDP/howto/docbook/Anti-Spam-HOWTO/.

For those without tldp CVS access, a tarball of the project files can be
downloaded at:

 http://cvsview.tldp.org/index.cgi/LDP/howto/docbook/Anti-Spam-HOWTO/Anti-Spam-HOWTO.tar.gz?tarball=1

Occasionally, HTML versions of the HOWTO itself will be posted during the 
development process at:

  http://feenix.burgiss.net/ldp/antispam/

And a single page HTML version will be also be available in CVS.

An authoring guide for the LDP can be found at to help those who are not
familiar with writing documentation in this type of format:

 http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LDP-Author-Guide/

That guide also describes how to use CVS. Anonymous CVS checkouts are
possible, and once the document has some structure we will send a message to
this list describing how to check it out. We can then discuss its contents on
the list.

There is a general list for discussions about the LDP, where the idea for this
project was born, at discuss@en.tldp.org, found along with other relevant
lists at:

 http://lists.tldp.org/

A mailing list has been created to aid contributors. This list is hosted on a
machine at McGill University's Network and Communication  Services where I
work. The list server runs commercial software that operates in ways perhaps
unfamiliar to  those of you who have subscribed to open-source mailing lists
in the past.

The following link describes how to use this software and how to change
preferences:

 http://www.mcgill.ca/ncs/email/listserv/users/

To subscribe, send a message to

 LISTSERV@LISTS.MCGILL.CA

with a blank subject line, and body without signature:

 SUB ANTI-SPAM-HOWTO firstname lastname

That should get you on the list.

For example, it is configured by default to send acknowledgements of postings.
If you  want to disable this feature, you send a message to

 LISTSERV@LISTS.MCGILL.CA

with no subject and body containing just :

 SET ANTI-SPAM-HOWTO NOACK

Other options are described in the user guide menioned in the url above.
