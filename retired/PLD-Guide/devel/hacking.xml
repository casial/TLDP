  <para>
    Following rules apply to making changes in PLD CVS repository.

            Always build before committing
          </emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>
          You may be sure you've just corrected some small error and it
          will not influence the build process... but try it.

        <para>
          <emphasis>
            If you have a large number of files to commit, do it in a 
            single run
          </emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>
          All commit messages are sent to the commit mailing list, 
          so if there are many messages, all our mailing lists will 
          be stuffed with loads of messages. Also people subscribed to 
          the commit list will get angry. Just do 
          <command>cvs ci</command>.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis>
            Don't put incomplete translations
          </emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>
          If English <literal>%description</literal> contains few lines of 
          text and you want to put just one translated line in another 
          language, just don't do it.  It is better to read full English 
          description than few words in mother tongue.
