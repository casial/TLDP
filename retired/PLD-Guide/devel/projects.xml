    <para>
      There are also several other projects in our CVS. Maintainers
      (or anybody else ;)
      are welcome to add them here. Projects listed above use PLD CVS
      as their main repository,  
      <literal>elinks</literal> and <literal>twin</literal> repositories
      are copied in PLD CVS.

      There is also lots of junk laying around in PLD repo :] It includes
      few dead projects, that didn't even start (like 
      <literal>doozy</literal>, <literal>trash</literal> and something 
      more I guess), or stuff imported there for some reason
      in the past, but abandoned later (like <literal>rh-4-installer</literal>).
