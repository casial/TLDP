    PLD is developed in two branches: <emphasis>stable</emphasis> and 
    <emphasis>devel</emphasis>. 
  </para>
  <para>
    Codename for <emphasis>devel</emphasis>
    is <literal>nest</literal>, it stands for <quote>Never Ending 
    STory</quote>.
  </para>
  <para>
    Name of the current stable PLD distribution is <literal>ra</literal>,
    version number is <literal>1.0</literal>. <literal>Ra</literal> stands
    for radium, Egyptian god of sun, one of the perfect 
    vowels and something else, I guess ;)
  </para>
  <para>
	  There are RPM's for both ra and nest on ftp. Ra is on the main ftp
	  server, but nest is located on separated ftp:
	  <ulink
		  url="ftp://ftp.nest.pld-linux.org/">ftp://ftp.nest.pld-linux.org/</ulink>
	  or
	  <ulink
		  url="http://ftp.nest.pld-linux.org/">http://ftp.nest.pld-linux.org/</ulink>.
    
    directories respectively.
  </para>
  <para>
    Current policy in CVS, is that packages for ra are in the HEAD, and
    packages for nest are in DEVEL branch (this ain't true for few packages,
    for example kernel has KERNEL_2_4 and rpm has rpm-4_0_4 branch, use
    <command>cvs status -v foo.spec</command> to find it out).
    This policy should change soon, though (nest will go to HEAD).
