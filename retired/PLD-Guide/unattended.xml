	  The config file can be created before you use bootdisk:
	  you may edit or generate it on any machine, than put onto
	  bootdisk. </para>
	<para>
	  First, create temporary <filename>etc</filename> dir somewhere, 
	  put installer.conf and other files into it.
	  You may also create etc/profile to avoid question about language, e.g:
	  <programlisting>export LANG=pl</programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
	  Then issue:
	  <programlisting>tar cf config.tar etc/</programlisting>
	  <programlisting>gzip -9nf config.tar</programlisting>

	  then mount bootkette,
	  and copy the file, or put file directly with mtools
	  <programlisting>mcopy config.tar.gz a:config.tgz</programlisting>

	  Filename must be changed to be placed on dos filesystem.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Just after booting, the bootkette system tries to mount floppy and searches
	  for <filename>config.tgz</filename>. If it is found its contents is extracted.
	</para>
