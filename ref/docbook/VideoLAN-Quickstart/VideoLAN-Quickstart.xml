Overview

</title>


<para>VideoLAN is a complete software solution for video streaming, developed
by students of the <ulink url="http://www.ecp.fr">Ecole Centrale
Paris</ulink> and developers from all over the world, under the
<ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</ulink> (GPL). VideoLAN is designed to stream MPEG videos on high
bandwidth networks.</para>

<para>The VideoLAN solution includes :</para>






<itemizedlist>


<listitem><para>VLS (VideoLAN Server), which can stream MPEG-1, MPEG-2
and MPEG-4 files, DVDs, digital satellite channels, digital terrestial
television channels and live videos on the network in unicast or
multicast,</para></listitem>





<listitem><para>VLC (initially VideoLAN Client), which can be used as
a server to stream MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 files, DVDs and live
videos on the network in unicast or multicast ; or used as a client
to receive, decode and display MPEG streams under multiple operating
systems.</para></listitem>

<para>A Pentium 100 MHz with 32 MB of memory should be enough to send one
stream on the network. When streaming a lot of videos stored on a
hard drive, the actual limitation is not the processor but the hard
drive and the network connection.</para>




<para>VLS works under Linux and Windows. To get the complete
list of VLS's possibilities on each plateform supported, see the <ulink url="http://www.videolan.org/streaming/features.html">streaming features

<simplesect><title>Mini-SAP-server</title>

<para>
You can add a channel information service based on the SAP/SDP
standard to the VideoLAN solution. The mini-SAP-server sends announces
about the multicast programs on the network in IPv4 or IPv6, and VLCs
receive these annouces and automatically add the programs announced to
their playlist.

</para>

<para>
The mini-SAP-server works under Linux and Mac OS X.

What is a codec ?
</title>



<para>
To fully understand the VideoLAN solution, you must
understand the difference between a <emphasis>codec</emphasis> and a
<emphasis>container format</emphasis>

</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>
A <emphasis>codec</emphasis> is a compression
algorithm, used to reduce the size of a stream. There are audio codecs
and video codecs. MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, Vorbis, DivX, ... are
codecs

</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
A <emphasis>container format</emphasis> contains
one or several streams already encoded by codecs. Very often, there
is an audio stream and a video one. AVI, Ogg, MOV, ASF, ... are
container formats. The streams contained can be encoded using different
codecs. In a perfect world, you could put any codec in any container
format. Unfortunately, there are some incompatibilities. You can
find a matrix of possible codecs and container formats on the <ulink url="http://www.videolan.org/streaming/features.html">features
page</ulink>


</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
To decode a stream, VLC first
<emphasis>demuxes</emphasis> it. This means that it reads the container
format and separates audio, video, and subtitles, if any. Then, each of
these are passed <emphasis>decoders</emphasis> that do the mathematical
processing to decompress the streams

.</para>


<para>
There is a particular thing about MPEG:

</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>
MPEG is a <emphasis>codec</emphasis>. There are
several versions of it, called MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, ...

</para></listitem>

<listitem>

<para>MPEG is also a container format, sometimes refered
to as <emphasis>MPEG System</emphasis>. There are several types of MPEG:
ES, PS, and TS</para>
<para>When you play an MPEG video from a DVD, for instance, the MPEG
stream is actually composed of several streams (called Elementary
Streams, ES): there is one stream for video, one for audio, another for
subtitles, and so on. These different streams are mixed together into a
single Program Stream (PS). So, the .VOB files you can find in a DVD are
actually MPEG-PS files. But this PS format is not adapted for streaming
video through a network or by satellite, for instance. So, another
format called Transport Stream (TS) was designed for streaming MPEG
videos through such channels.</para>

Command line usage

</title>

<itemizedlist>


<listitem><para>

VLC has many different graphical interfaces, that
are organized quite differently in order to be in harmony with the
guidelines of each operating system supported. Documenting the use
of each graphical interface is too long, and some features are only
available via the command line interface. Therefore we decided to
document only the command line interface, but in many cases it shoud
be easy to guess how to use the graphical interface for the same use
!

VLS has a command line and a telnet interface, but no
graphical interface !

Multicast to several VLC's

</title>

<simplesect><title>
What is multicast ?

</title>


<para>Multicast is a norm implemented in all modern network hardware
(switches, routers, ...). It provides an intelligent manner to send a
stream to a dynamic group of machines. If you want to use multicast,
make sure that all your network hardware support it.</para>

<para>In multicast streaming, the stream is sent to a multicast IP
address (the IP addresses reserved for this purpose are from 224.0.0.0
to 239.255.255.255). Then, any machine on the network can join the
multicast group by sending a request on the network, and it will
automatically receive the stream. When it sends a request to leave the
group, it will automatically stop receiving the stream. The advantage
of multicast streaming is that only the machines that want to receive
the stream actually receive it, and the streaming server only sends one
stream even if there are multiple clients receiving it.</para>

Video On Demand

</title>

<sect1><title>
Overview


</title>

<para>With Video On Demand (VOD), the user can start the video when he
wants, make pauses, go forward and back in the video. It is of course
the best in video streaming and the dream for every user.</para>

<para>VOD is a very big consumer of resources for the server and the
network. VOD is unicast, not multicast : this means that the network
and server resources needed are directly proportional to the number of
clients.</para>

<para>The design of VideoLAN's VOD solution is very simple. The idea
is to do HTTP streaming, i.e. stream an MPEG video encapsulated in
HTTP. The regulation of the bitrate between the client and the server
is done automatically by TCP. With HTTP version 1.1, there is the
possibility to seek in a file downloaded, that's what we use to seek in
the video.</para>





</sect1>

<sect1><title>
On the server side

</title>


<para>On the VOD server, you need a running Web server. For example,
you can use a Linux server running Apache. Other operating systems
and other Web servers should work too, but we have never tested.</para>

<para>Make your MPEG-1, MPEG-2 or MPEG-4 / DivX files available to the
clients on the Web server.</para>

<para>For example, we have a Web server whose DNS name
is <emphasis>localserver</emphasis>. On this server,
we put an MPEG file <filename moreinfo="none">video1.mpg</filename>
which will be available to the clients at the URL
<filename moreinfo="none">http://localserver/video1.mpg</filename>.</para>




</sect1>

<sect1><title>
On the client side

</title>


<screen format="linespecific">
<prompt moreinfo="none">% </prompt><userinput moreinfo="none">vlc -vvv http://localserver/video1.mpg</userinput>
</screen>





<para>VLC starts to read the stream nearly immediately and you can
seek in the stream, make pauses, etc... as if the stream was a local
file.</para>

<chapter id="vlc-sap"><title id="tvlc-sap">
Add a channel information service

</title>


<para>Typing multicast addresses is not very fun... that's why you need
a channel information service ! VideoLAN has implemented a channel
information service based on the SAP/SDP standard. VLC's stream output
can send SAP announces when streaming (on the multicast address
<emphasis>224.2.127.254</emphasis> reserved for this purpose). On the
client side, VLCs receive these annouces and automatically add the
programs announced to their playlist. </para>




<sect1><title>
Send announces when streaming with VLC

</title>

<para>
To send announces with VLC, you need to use the complex syntax of
VLC's stream output, like this:

</para>

<screen format="linespecific">
<prompt moreinfo="none">% </prompt><userinput moreinfo="none">vlc -vvv video1.xyz --sout '#standard{access=udp,url=239.255.12.42,sap=&quot;Test Stream&quot;}' --ttl 12</userinput>
</screen>


<para>where <filename moreinfo="none">video1.xyz</filename> is the file you want
to stream, <emphasis>239.255.12.42</emphasis> is the multicast IP
address you want to stream on, <emphasis>Test Stream</emphasis> is
the name that will be used for this program in the SAP announces and
<emphasis>12</emphasis> is the value of the TTL (Time To Live) of the
stream and of the SAP announces.</para>




</sect1>

<sect1><title>
Start VLC(s) on the client(s)

</title>

<para>
Start VLC with the <emphasis>sap</emphasis> interface:

</para>

<screen format="linespecific">
<prompt moreinfo="none">% </prompt><userinput moreinfo="none">vlc -vvv --extraintf sap</userinput>
</screen>


<para>Then open the playlist: you should see the names of the programs
announced in SAP. When you double-click on the name of a program,
VLC will subscribe to the multicast address and start to play the stream
!</para>




</sect1>
</chapter>



<chapter id="conclusion"><title id="tconclusion">Conclusion</title>



<para>VideoLAN can do much more than what is explained in this
Quickstart. For example, you can use VLC to display image walls or
to transcode a stream on-the-fly. You can also use VLS to stream
digital satellite channels and digital terrestial TV channels. To
know about the full possibilities of VideoLAN, please read the rest
of the official documentation, that you can find on the <ulink url="http://www.videolan.org/doc/">documentation page</ulink>.</para>

<para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
other functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.</para>

<para>This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
designed for free software.</para>

<para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="gfdl-1"><title>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>

<para id="gfdl-doc">This License applies to any manual or other work, in
any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
it can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use
that work under the conditions stated herein.  The &quot;Document&quot;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under
copyright law.</para>

<para id="gfdl-mod-ver">A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any
work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim,
or with modifications and/or translated into another language.</para>

<para id="gfdl-secnd-sect">A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or
a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing
that could fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the
Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may
not explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
regarding them.</para>

<para id="gfdl-inv-sect">The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary
Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant
Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under
this License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The
Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not
identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.</para>

<para id="gfdl-cov-text">The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of
text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
notice that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at
most 25 words.</para>

<para id="gfdl-transparent">A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a
machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is
available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the
document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable
for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent
file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to
thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if used for any
substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called
&quot;Opaque&quot;.</para>

<para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.</para>

<para id="gfdl-title-page">The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book,
the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold,
legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title
Page&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's
title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</para>

<para id="gfdl-entitled">A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit
of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in
parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language.
(Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
&quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.)  To
&quot;Preserve the Title&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document
means that it remains a section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this
definition.</para>

<para>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
which states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
meaning of this License.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="gfdl-2"><title>VERBATIM COPYING</title>

<para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</para>

<para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
and you may publicly display copies.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="gfdl-3"><title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>

<para>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the full title
with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited
to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
respects.</para>

<para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.</para>

<para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
network-using public has access to download using public-standard
network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of
added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,
to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
stated location until at least one year after the last time you
distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers)
of that edition to the public.</para>

<para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.</para>

These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</para>

<para>You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it
contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various

list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes
a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by
arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may
not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission
from the previous publisher that added the old one.</para>

publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.  Make the
same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections
in the license notice of the combined work.</para>

<para>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled

the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers
that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic

<sect1 id="gfdl-8"><title>TRANSLATION</title>

<para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warrany Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between the
translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</para>

<para>If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
&quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.</para>

<sect1 id="gfdl-9"><title>TERMINATION</title>

<para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License
will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain
in full compliance.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="gfdl-10"><title>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>

<para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</para>

<para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of
this License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option
of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version
or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="gfdl-addendum"><title>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for
  your documents</title>

<para>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy
of the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:</para>

<blockquote id="copyright-sample"><para>
    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &quot;GNU
    Free Documentation License&quot;.
</para></blockquote>

<para>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the &quot;with...Texts.&quot; line with this:</para>

<blockquote id="inv-cover-sample"><para>
    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
</para></blockquote>

<para>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.</para>

<para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.</para>
