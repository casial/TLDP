<sect>What is WordPerfect
<p>
WordPerfect is a popular, fully-featured commercial 
word processor program that is available for multiple platforms
including Linux.  It was originally 
written and sold by WordPerfect Corporation, subsequently 
purchased by Novell, then purchased about a year or so ago by
Corel Corporation (Ottawa, Ontario, CA).  Corel has outsourced the
development of WordPerfect for UNIX (including Linux) to SDC Corporation,
a corporation including former WordPerfect developers, and specializing
in development for UNIX and X windows.

<p>
Until the release of Microsoft Word, WordPerfect was the most popular 
word processor for personal computers 
(it still claims to be by volume of product shipped, some reports 
indicate that more copies were sold than Microsoft Word during recent
months). WordPerfect was originally written for DOS and later ported to the 
UNIX and Windows environments.  Initial versions of WordPerfect for
Windows were very late to market and tended to crash a lot, hence opening 
the floodGATES for Microsoft Word.  WordPerfect is still a better word processor
than Word for large documents or documents that must be moved between
Mac, UNIX, and Microsoft platforms.  

<p>
WordPerfect provides a WYSWYG environment for editing text documents.  One
of the best features is the ability to check your spelling as you type.
Included are grammar checker, spelling checker, graphics import and export,
and the ability to edit HTML documents.  Documents created by WordPerfect
on one platform may be read, edited, and printed on other platforms (I
have generated a lot of documents using WP 6.0 (Caldera's release) 
and distributed them to 
Windows 95 users using WP 7.0 or 8.0).

<p>
WordPerfect runs on the following platforms (release or beta versions):
<itemize>
<item>Linux 1.2.13 (WordPerfect 6.0 for Linux, sold by Caldera)
<item>Linux 2.0.X (WordPerfect 6.0 and WordPerfect 7.0)
<item>Microsoft DOS, Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows NT 
<item>Macintosh
<item>HP-UX 10.01
<item>IBM AIX 4.1.4
<item>SCO OpenServer 5.0.0
<item>Sun SPARC Solaris 2.5
<item>SUN SPARC SunOS 4.1.x
<item>SUN X86 Solaris 2.5.1
<item>Digital UNIX 3.2 G Alpha
<item>SCO 3.2.4.2
</itemize>
<p>

<sect>WordPerfect 7.0 Beta
<p>
<sect1>Impressions of 7.0
<p>
I have been very impressed with the operation of WordPerfect 7.0 for 
Linux.  I only recently downloaded it and tried it.  It looks like
WP 7.0 for Windows.  The features appear to work properly.  I especially
like the spell-as-you-go feature!
<p>
The HTML publisher works a little better than that on WP 6.0, but still
has some bugs.  Someone reported that WP 7.0 requires a lot of 
swap space (I have not tested it at this time).

<sect1>Getting WordPerfect 7.0
<p>
WP 7.0 is available as several LARGE tarballs from sdcorp's FTP
site (or via the WWW).  I tried for two days to download the 26MB
archive using ISDN but only was able to get part of the file.  I 
eventually had to use a commercial account with a T1 to
the Internet to get the files.  It would be much easier to download
if each tarball was split into several smaller files (1-2 MB in size). 
Note, when you uncompress the tarballs, the result is a small number
of medium sized files -- just what is needed.
<p>
The current version that you can download is time limited to 15 days.
During this time, you can pay them and they will give you a license 
for it.  

<p>
<verb>
   For WP 7.0 Beta:

	ftp://ftp.sdcorp.com/pub/linux_betab/wp7linuxbetab.tar.gz

	      4887525 graphics_tar.gz
	     17652138 manual_tar.gz
	       450535 wp60ms01_us.all
	       290443 wp60ps01_us.all
	     26962514 wp7linuxbetab_tar.gz
</verb>

<p>

<sect1>Installation of 7.0
<p>
To install, you must extract the tarballs, run the <bf>Runme</bf> program,
answer some questions and then run xwp to start WP 7.0.  Note, you need
58 MB just for WP 7.0, prior to the manuals, graphics, etc.
<p>
<enum>
<item>Extract the tarball into a temporary directory, need 31M
<verb>
	      tar xvzf wp7linuxbetab_tar.gz

		with WP 6.0 were used!
</enum>
<p>

<sect1>Features
<p>
<itemize>
<item>WordPerfect word processor
<item>Internet publisher
<item>QuickCorrect - fix your typos while typing
<item>Spell-As-You-Go - spell checking while typing
<item>File compatibility with DOS, UNIX, and other WordPerfect versions on
      other platforms
</itemize>

<sect1>Bugs in 7.0
<p>
<itemize>
<item>HTML export of a WP document with headers and footers 
      sometimes leaves the bottom of the document either centered or bold.
<item>HTML export of a WP document with a table of contents does not 
      generate cross references.
<item>HTML export messes up the table of contents and if sections were
      outlined, they become HTML list items and no longer match the TOC.
<item>Installation of the manual failed.  I have not had time to try
      to fix this problem.
<item>Someone reported a problem converting WPG graphics to JPG.
<item>WP 7.0 <bf>can not</bf> read files from Office97 (this has been
      a major pain for me as I have received several such files from others
      and I do not have Office97).
<item>Someone reported a possible problem with getting printing to work 
      (I had no problems at all).
<item>Upon starting xwp, I received a message that some backup files
      existed.  Upon clicking on the first backup file, XWP dumped core.
</itemize>

<sect1>Pricing and Availability
<p>
Upgrade pricing expected to be &dollar;149.99 (US) and retail pricing &dollar;199.99.


<sect>WordPerfect 6.0 (Caldera)
<p>
Caldera sells both a WordPerfect and Motif Bundle (&dollar;130 US) 
and the Caldera Internet Office Suite (&dollar;219 US).  Both include 
WordPerfect 6.0 for Linux.  
<p>
Overall, WP 6.0 has been good to me.  I have generated 20-30 large
documents and numerous small ones, probably 1000+ pages if I printed
them all out.  The only problem that I have is that I use WP Times 
font under Linux and it is not compatible with the WP True Type Times
font under Windows.

<sect1>Impressions of 6.0
<p>
The author has been using WordPerfect for Linux on Caldera 
Network Desktop (CND) for the past year.  The system is a 
P6/200, 64M RAM, SCSI, CND 1.0 with RiskyHack patches to 
the Linux 2.0.30 kernel, updated RPM, and many, many RPMS from
Redhat and Caldera's WWW sites.


<sect1>Getting WordPerfect 6.0
<p>
Visit Caldera's WWW site at <url url="http://www.caldera.com"
			name="http://www.caldera.com">


<sect1>Installation of 6.0
<p>
Installation was easy. I just followed the directions provided....  
<p>
I did have to add <bf>wp</bf> to my fvwm menu (I am using FVWM95
on CND 1.0 with lots of patches) and to looking glass's menus.
<p>
My platform is a P6/200, 64M RAM, Caldera CND 1.0, RiskyHacks to libc 5.4.4,
kernel 2.0.30 (Joliet and FAT32 patches), dual SCSI, CD-R, etc.
WP uses 74 MB of disk space.

<sect1>Bugs in 6.0
<p>
<itemize>
<item>Export to HTML has several bugs with complex documents requiring some
      reformatting.
<item>Occasional crashes (very rare).
<item>Occasionally WP loops where it uses all memory and runs out of swap space,
      then crashes.
<item>Some fonts are different between Windows and UNIX versions.
<item>It has been reported to me that some WP macros for UNIX versions 
      are different than those for Windows versions.
</itemize>

<p>
<sect>WordPerfect 5.1 and 6.0 (SCO release)
<p>
I started using WP 5.1 for SCO (which was statically linked) since January,
1995. In the Spring, 1995, I obtained a copy of WP 6.0 for SCO 
(dynamic linked) and was able to install it with some
pain. I subsequently have had some problems with the license manager. I have it
running under 1.2.8. 
<p>
This section is mainly from the original WordPerfect mini-howto.  It has
not been used in a long time.  Note, the more recent versions of WP for 
SCO included both the dynamic and static linked versions, and hence
did NOT require SCO's shared libraries.  
<p>
<bf>This is mainly for background information!  If you really want 
WP for Linux, get the new WP 7.0!</bf>

<sect1>Impressions of WP/SCO
<p>
WP for SCO seemed to work fine (once the installation problems were overcome).
I used this distribution for about 6-12 months until I received a copy of
WP 6.0 for Linux (Caldera) and CND 1.0.


<sect1>Getting WordPerfect WP/SCO

<sect1>Installation of WP/SCO
<p>

<sect2>Requirements
<p>

<itemize>
<item> Linux 1.1.x to 1.2.x 
<item> modules (dynamic module loading software) 
<item> iBCS2 (Intel BCS2 and ELF loader module) 
<item> SCO dynamic libs (if required) 
<item> Domainname should be setup 
<item> Hostname should be setup and be less than 8 characters (localhost is 9) 
</itemize>

<sect2>Kernel Requirements
<p>
The kernel should be setup for module support and ELF support. If you have already
done this, skip this step, else, do the following as root: 

<itemize>
<item> Load kernel in /usr/src/linux&lsqb;.xxx&rsqb; and make sure that the symbolic link to the
      /usr/include/linux and /usr/include/asm directories are setup (see
      /usr/src/linux/README). 
<item> Build module support and install it (see below) 
<item> Build iBCS2 module and install it (see below) 
<item> Build kernel with module and ELF support (answer Y to BINFMT_ELF and
       MOD_VERSIONS) 
<item> Reboot on new kernel 
<item> Note: you have to build the module support file "genksyms" PRIOR to making
       your new kernel (telling the kernel to export symbols:
       CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y). 
</itemize>

<sect2>Modules
<p>

Loadable module support is required for iBCS2 and hence to run WP 6.0. Get the
latest from the ftp sites, build it, and install it. If you have 
already setup your system for loadable modules, skip this step. 
Loadable module support (/sbin/insmod,
/sbin/rmmod, /sbin/lsmod) is required. With recent kernels, genksyms is also
required. 

<itemize>
<item> File: modules-1.1.87.tar.gz (or latest) 
<item> Put tar file in /usr/src/modules and build module support 
<item> Read the README in /usr/src/modules (or wherever you put it) 
<item> Cd to /usr/src/modules/genksyms and make genksysms, install it in
       /usr/local/bin (or /sbin) 
</itemize>

<sect2>iBCS2 Emulator
<p>
The iBCS2 emulator allows you to run SCO binaries such as WordPerfect 6.0. Get
the latest from the ftp sites, build it, and install it. 

<itemize>
<item> Build and install in /usr/lib/modules 
<item> Read the HINTS file (/usr/src/ibcs/Doc/HINTS) 
<item> Make sure that iBCS2 sets up /dev/XOR, if not, create a symbolic link from
       /dev/null to /dev/XOR (cd /dev; ln -s /dev/null /dev/XOR) 
</itemize>

The interfaces to some subsystems occur at the device layer and thus you need to
create some device files in order to use them: 

<verb>

        * /dev/socksys and /dev/nfsd - interface for SVr3 STREAMS based
          TCP/IP applications

          &num mknod /dev/socksys c 30 0
          &num ln -s /dev/socksys /dev/nfsd

        [WARNING:  the below may already be setup as /dev/inet, 
         /dev/arp, etc., they may have other major/minor numbers,
         if so, skip this step]

        * /dev/inet/{arp,icmp,ip,rip,tcp,udp} - more network hooks

          &num mknod /dev/inet/arp c 30 2
          &num mknod /dev/inet/icmp c 30 2
          &num mknod /dev/inet/ip c 30 2
          &num mknod /dev/inet/rip c 30 2
          &num mknod /dev/inet/tcp c 30 2
          &num mknod /dev/inet/udp c 30 2

        [THIS IS REQUIRED AND WILL USUALLY HAVE TO BE DONE MANUALLY!]
        * /dev/X0R - server side of SVR3 local X interface
          (see comments in Doc/Local-X)

          &num ln -s /dev/null /dev/X0R

        * /dev/spx - client side of SVR3 local X interface
          (see comments in Doc/Local-X)

          &num mknod /dev/spx c 30 1
</verb>

<sect2>SCO Shared Libraries
<p>

<bf>DO NOT VIOLATE SCO's COPYRIGHTS!</bf> You should get a copy of SCO's shared
libraries and install them in /shlib. As root: 

<itemize>
<item> cd /; mkdev /shlib; chmod 755 /shlib 
<item> if required, make a temporary directory and set TMPDIR to it (export
       TMPDIR=/mytmpdir) 
<item> Copy the following SCO shared libraries from the SCO machine to Linux and
   put in /shlib: 
<verb>
    	 /shlib/libX11R5_s 
	 /shlib/libXtXm* 
</verb>
</itemize>

<sect2>Loading WP60
<p>

Make sure that you have LOTS of space in your /tmp directory. If you do not have
lots of space, make a tmp directory and set the environment variable TMPDIR to it.
As root first try the following: 

<itemize>
<item> Mount the CD (e.g., to /cdrom) 
<item> cd to the CDROM and run the ./install script 
</itemize>
<p>
If you get the following error you may not have enough space in your /tmp directory,
make a new tmp directory and set the environment variable TMPDIR (see above): 

<verb>
  ERROR:  not enough space in /tmp, or this is an unsupported machine.
</verb>

If all else fails, you may have to do it manually per these notes: 

<itemize>
<item> get iBCS2 running 
<item> copy the &dollar;WPDIR/cdrom/install.wp to &dollar;WPDIR and edit it &lsqb;I changed it so I
   could create /tmp/WpTmP on an NFS server (did not have the space locally). I
   then ran the program and made changes until I got it to startup.&rsqb;
<item> change to TMPDIR and run: ifiles/cdlink.sco -r /usr/local/wp60/cdrom This
   builds links with the proper names but the permissions are not set properly. 
<item> make a temp directory on the server and copy all files to it: 
<verb>
	cp -r  WpTmP/wp60/SCO/* wp60 
</verb>
<item> change to the temp wp60 directory and changed permissions. cd wp60; chmod
       555 wpinstall install/* 
<item> run the wpinstall program and answered the questions. 
<item> Because I still have the flexlm license manager for WP51 on the system, I had
       to manually run wplicense -e and create a new license.dat. 
<item> Start WP60.
</itemize>

<sect2>License Manager
<p>
WordPerfect uses a license manager (see the manuals). This is a tricky beast that
sometimes does not work properly under Linux (I have had it fail, done something
else then I was able to start it). If you have problems call WordPerfect and they can
assist you. Please <bf>RTFM</bf> the documentation section on the license manager. 

<p>
To start the license manager, as root: 

<verb>
	&num cd &dollar;WPDIR/shbin10 
	&num ./wplicense -s 
</verb>

<sect2>Starting WP60
<p>
<itemize>
<item> start iBCS2 
<item> start the license manager 
<item> setup your DISPLAY environment variable (e.g., export DISPLAY=gator:0) 
<item> run xwp (&dollar;WPDIR/wpbin/xwp filename.wpf &amp;) 
</itemize>
<p>
If you get the errors: 

<verb>
  /dev/XOR: No such file or directory
  Error: Can't open display: :0.0
</verb>
<p>
You need to set up your DISPLAY environment variable (per above) and possibly
setup the link to the device /dev/XOR (cd /dev; ln -s /dev/null /dev/XOR). 
<p>
Note if WP "steals" the colors from your X server (a problem if the depth is only 256
colors), disable the display of the graphics banner page by doing the following: 
<itemize>
<item> Start XWP 
<item> From the control window, click on Preferences 
<item> from the Preferences window, select ENVIRONMENT 
<item> From the ENVIRONMENT window, turn off the checkbox for "Graphical
       Banner and Startup Screen" 
</itemize>

<sect2>RC Scripts
<p>
You will need to add a line to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local script (or similar) to start iBCS2
and the WP license manager (if desired). 

<verb>
	&num /sbin/insmod /usr/lib/modules/iBCS &amp; 
	&num &dollar;WPDIR/shbin10/wplicense -s &amp; 
</verb>

<sect2>Changes to install
<p>
This was extracted from my original notes and includes changes to 
<bf>install.wp</bf> that are reported to work:
<P>
The install.wp on the CDROM did not work out of the box. I had to modify it to get it
to work by moving all files to a temporary directory and changing this install script.
The changes are:

<sect1>Bugs in WP/SCO
<p>
I did not keep a detailed list of bugs for WP/SCO, however:
<itemize>
<item>The initial version had install problems.
<item>The initial version used SCO shared libraries, hence required a copy of 
      them on Linux.
</itemize>

<sect>The Future
<p>
Sometime in August, WordPerfect 7.0 for Linux should ship.  It should
be available from 	
<url url="http://www.sdcorp.com/wpunix.html" name="SDC"> for 
about &dollar;149.99 for a competitive upgrade or &dollar;199.99 retail.

<p>
Corel is working on porting their entire office suite to Java and 
releasing it as Corel Office for Java(TM).  This currently is in Beta
and works on Linux (I tried the first beta -- very slow).  Check out
<url url="http://officeforjava.corel.com/about.htm"
name="http://officeforjava.corel.com/about.htm"> for more information.
This promises to be something to watch.

<p>
SDC is currently working on WPLinux 8 with an expected beta mid 1998 
and a release following by about 5 months.  SDC has indicated that
if there is not sufficient demand for WP for Linux, they will probably 
not ship it (they already stopped shipping for SGI and UNIXWare) --
<bf>so if you like it, buy it!</bf>

<sect>For More Information
<p>
<bf>Software Development Corporation</bf> is the developer of WordPerfect for UNIX.
Corel has outsourced the development of WordPerfect for UNIX to SDC.  I have been
in touch with the SDC product manager for WP for LINUX and he has been very 
helpful (I have provided him with a review copy of this document).
