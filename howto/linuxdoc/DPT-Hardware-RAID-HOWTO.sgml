<abstract>
How to set up hardware RAID under Linux. This HOWTO is now limited to
making small changes from version 1.6.
</abstract>

<!-- ************************************************************* -->

<toc>

<sect>  Introduction

<p> This document describes how to set up SCSI hardware RAID, focusing
mainly on host-based adapters from DPT, though the principles applied
here are fairly general. </p>

<p> Use the information below at your own risk.  I disclaim all
responsibility for anything you may do after reading this HOWTO. The
latest version of this HOWTO will always be available at <htmlurl
url="http://www.ram.org/computing/linux/dpt_raid.html"
name="http://www.ram.org/computing/linux/dpt_raid.html">. </p> 

<p> For the purposes of this HOWTO, I am assuming you have only a
Linux system running. Also, note that I've only tried this out with
the DPT Smartcache IV PM2144UW and PM3334UW controllers, with DPT
(SmartRAID tower) and Wetex enclosures, and I have no experience with
other setups. So things may be different for your setup. </p>

</sect>

<!-- ************************************************************* -->

<sect> Supported controllers

<!-- ************************************************************* -->

<p> One well-supported host-based hardware RAID controller (i.e, a
controller for which there exists a driver under Linux) is one that is
made by <url url="http://www.dpt.com" name="DPT">. However, there
exist other host-based and SCSI-to-SCSI controllers which may work
under Linux.  These include the ones made by <url
url="http://www.syred.com" name="Syred">, <url
url="http://www.icp-vortex.com" name="ICP-Vortex">, and <url
url="http://www.mylex.com" name="BusLogic">.  See the <url
url="http://linas.org/linux/raid.html" name="RAID solutions for Linux
page"> for more info. </p>

<p> If, in the future, there is support for other controllers, I will
do my best to incorporate that information into this HOWTO. Please
send me any such information you think is appropriate for this
HOWTO. </p> 

<!-- ************************************************************* -->

<sect1> DPT controllers

<p> This document is currently DPT-oriented.  Essentially all the
SmartRAID IV controllers are supported. </p>

</sect1>

<!-- ************************************************************* -->

<sect1> ICP vortex controllers

<p> ICP vortex has a complete line of disk array controllers which
support Linux.  The ICP driver is in the Linux kernel since version
2.0.31. All major Linux Distributors S.u.S.e., LST Power Linux, Caldera
and Red Hat support the ICP controllers as boot/installation
controllers. The RAID system can easily be configured with their
ROMSETUP (you do not have to boot MS-DOS for configuration!). </p>

<p> With the monitoring utility GDTMON it is possible to manage the
complete ICP RAID system during operation (check transfer rates, set
parameters for the controller and hard disks, exchange defective hard
disks, etc.).  Currently available are: 1 and 2 channel wide and ultra
SCSI controller for RAID 0 and RAID 1 1, 2, 3 and 5 chn. wide and
ultra SCSI controller for RAID 0, 1, 4, 5 and 10 1 and 2 channel wide
and ultra2 LVDS SCSI controller for RAID 0 and RAID 1 1, 2, 3 and 5
chn. wide and ultra2 LVDS SCSI controller for RAID 0, 1, 4, 5 and 10 1
and 2 port Fibre Channel controllers for RAID 0, 1, 4, 5 and 10 Pretty
soon there will be also 64-bit controllers available. </p>

<p> ICP is transitioning the entry-level RS series from Ultra2 SCSI to
Ultra160 SCSI.  The drivers, firmware, features, capabilities etc
remain the same.  They are still 32 Bit cards with the i960RS
processor working at 100MHz.  The only difference is they will work at
Ultra160 (data transfer rate of 160MB/sec) rather than Ultra2 (data
transfer of 80MB/sec). </p>

<p> Effective immediately, the GDT7523RN units will become GDT8523RZ
and the GDT7623RN units will become GDT8623RZ.  The transition from
33MHz on the PCI bus to 66MHz represents a huge potential performance
increase.  The new cards will have the new Intel 80303 "Zion"
processor, allowing bus master transfer rates of up to 528MB/sec, and
will take up to 256MB of ECC RAM on PC133 SDRAM Dimms.  </p>

</sect1>

<!-- ************************************************************* -->

<sect> What hardware should be used?

<!-- ************************************************************* -->

<sect1> Controller type

<p> Given all these options, if you're looking for a RAID solution,
you need to think carefully about what you want.  Depending on what
you want to do, and which RAID level you wish to use, some cards may
be better than others.  SCSI-to-SCSI adapters may not be as good as
host-based adapters, for example.  Michael Neuffer (<htmlurl
url="mailto:neuffer@uni-mainz.de"
name="neuffer@uni-mainz.de">), the author of the EATA-DMA
driver, has a nice discussion about this on his <url
url="http://www.uni-mainz.de/~neuffer/scsi/" name="Linux High
Performance SCSI and RAID page">. </p>

</sect1>

<sect1> Enclosure type

<p> The enclosure type affects the hot swap-ability of the drive, the
warning systems (i.e., whether there will be indication of failure,
and whether you will know which drive has failed), and what kind of
treatment your drive receives (for example, redundant cooling and
power supplies).  We used the DPT supplied enclosures which work
extremely well, but they are expensive.  </p>

</sect1>

</sect>

<sect> Installation

<sect1> Installing and configuring the hardware

<p> Refer to the instruction manual to install the card and the
drives. For DPT, since a storage manager for Linux doesn't exist yet,
you need to create a MS-DOS-formatted disk with the system on it
(usually created using the command "format /s" at the MS-DOS prompt).
You will also be using the DPT storage manager for MS-DOS (available
from <url url="http://www.adaptec.com" name="the Adaptec website">),
which you should probably make a copy of for safety. </p>

<p> Once the hardware is in place, boot using the DOS system
disk. Replace the DOS disk with the storage manager. And invoke the
storage manager using the command: 

<tscreen><verb>
a:\ dptmgr
</verb></tscreen>

Wait a minute or so, and you'll get a nice menu of options.  Configure
the set of disks as a hardware RAID (single logical array). Choose
"other" as the operating system. </p>

<p> The MS-DOS storage manager is a lot easier to use with a mouse,
and so you might want to have a mouse driver on the initial system
disk you create. </p>

<p> Technically, it should be possible to run the SCO storage manager
under Linux, but it may be more trouble than its worth.  It's probably
more easier to run the MS-DOS storage manager under Linux. </p>

</sect1>

<sect1> Configuring the kernel 

<p> You will need to configure the kernel with SCSI support and the
appropriate low level driver.  See the <url
url="http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html" name="Kernel
HOWTO"> for information on how to compile the kernel. Once you choose
"yes" for SCSI support, in the low level drivers section, select the
driver of your choice (EATA DMA or EATA ISA/EISA/PCI for most EATA DMA
compliant (DPT) cards, EATA PIO for the very old PM2001 and PM2012A
from DPT).  Most drivers, including the EATA DMA and EATA ISA/EISA/PCI
drivers, should be available in recent kernel versions.  </p>

<p> Once you have the kernel compiled, reboot, and if you've set up
everything correctly, you should see the driver recognising the RAID
as a single SCSI disk. If you use RAID-5, you will see the size of
this disk to be 2/3 of the actual disk space available. </p>

</sect1>

<sect1> Bootup messages 

<p> The messages you see upon bootup if you're using the EATA DMA
driver should look something like this:

(The above display is for a setup with two SCSI controllers, DPT
PM3224W and and Adaptec AHA2940.) </p>

</sect1>

</sect>

<sect> Usage

<sect1> fdisk, mke2fs, mount, etc.

<p> You can now start treating the RAID as a regular disk. The first
thing you'll need to do is partition the disk (using fdisk).  You'll
then need to set up an ext2 filesystem.  This can be done
by running the command:

<tscreen><verb>
% mkfs -t ext2 /dev/sdxN
</verb></tscreen>

where /dev/sdxN is the name of the SCSI partition.  Once you do this,
you'll be able to mount the partitions and use them as you would any
other disk (including adding entries in /etc/fstab).  </p>

</sect1>

<sect1> Hot swapping 

<p> We first tried to test hot swapping by removing a drive and putting
it back in the DPT-supplied enclosure/tower (which you buy for an
additional cost).  Before we could carry this out to completion, one
of the disks failed (as I write this, the beeping is driving me
crazy). Even though one of the disks failed, all the data on the RAID
drive was accessible. </p>

<p> Instead of replacing the drive, we just went through the motions
of hot swapping and put the same drive back in.  The drive rebuilt
itself and everything turned out okay.  During the time the disk had
filed, and during the rebuilding process, all the data was
accessible. Though it should be noted that if another disk had failed,
we'd have been in serious trouble.  </p>

</sect1>

<sect1> Performance 

<p> Here's the output of the Bonnie program, on a 2144 UW with 9x3=17
GB RAID 5 setup, using the EATA DMA driver. The RAID is on a dual
processor Pentium Pro machine running Linux 2.0.33. For comparison,
the Bonnie results for the IDE drive on that machine are also given.

</p>

<p> Some people have disputed the above timings (and rightly so---I've
been unable to try it out on our machines since they're completely loaded)
because the size of the file used may have led to it being cached
(resulting in an unusually good performance report).  Here are some
timings with a 3344 UW controller:

<sect> Features in the EATA DMA driver

<p> This section describes some of the commands available under Linux
to check on the RAID configuration.  Again, while references to the
eata_dma driver is made, this can be used to check up on any
driver. </p>

<p> To see the configuration for your driver, type: 

<tscreen><verb>
% cat /proc/scsi/eata_dma/N
</verb></tscreen>

where N is the host id for the controller.  You should see something
like this:

</sect>

<sect>  Troubleshooting

<sect1> Upon bootup, no SCSI hosts are detected

<p> This could be due to several reasons, but it's probably because
the appropriate driver is not configured in the kernel. Check and make
sure the appropriate driver (EATA-DMA or EATA ISA/EISA/PCI for most
DPT cards) is configured. </p>

</sect1>

<sect1> RAID configuration shows up as N different disks

<p> The RAID has not been configured properly.  If you're using a DPT
storage manager, you need to configure the RAID disks as a single
logical array.  Michael Neuffer (<htmlurl
url="mailto:neuffer@uni-mainz.de"
name="neuffer@uni-mainz.de">) writes: "When you configure
the controller with the SM start it with the parameter /FW0 and/or
select Solaris as OS. This will cause the array setup to be managed
internally by the controller." </p>

<sect1> Machine/controller is shut down in the middle of a format

<p> As stated in the DPT manual, this is clearly a no-no and might
require the disks to be returned to the manufacturer, since the DPT
Storage Manager might not be able format it. However, you might be
able to perform a low level format on it, using a program supplied by
DPT, called clfmt in their utilities page. Read the
instructions after unzipping the clfmt.zip file on how to use it (and
use it wisely). Once you do the low level format, you might be able to
treat the disks like new. Use this program carefully!  </p>

</sect1>

<sect1> SCSI_ABORT_BUSY errors produced during initial filesystem format

<p> When you do a <tt>mke2fs</tt> on the SCSI drive, you may see errors
of the form:

<tscreen><verb>
scsi: aborting command due to timeout : pid xxx, scsi0, channel 0, id
2, lun 0
write (10) xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx
eata_abort called pid xxx target: 2 lun: 0 reason: 3
Returning: SCSI_ABORT_BUSY
</verb></tscreen>

and this might end up causing the machine to freeze.  I (and many
others) have been able to fix this problem by simply reading one or
two hundred MB from the RAID array with <tt>dd</tt> like this:

<tscreen><verb>
% dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/null bs=1024k count=128
</verb></tscreen>

</p>

<p> During a format, a fast rush of requests for chunks of memory that
is directly accessible is made, and sometimes the memory manager
cannot deliver it on time anymore.  The <tt>dd</tt> is a workaround
that will simply create the requests sequentially instead of one huge
heap at once like the format tends to create it. </p>

</sect1>

<sect1> If all fails...

<p> Read the SCSI-HOWTO again.  Check the cabling and the termination.
Try a different machine if you have access to one.  The most common
cause of problems with SCSI devices and drivers is because of faulty
or misconfigured hardware.  Finally, you can post to the various
newsgroups or e-mail me, and I'll do my best to get back to you. </p>
