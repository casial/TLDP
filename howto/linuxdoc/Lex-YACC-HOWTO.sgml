<sect>Introduction
<p>
Welcome, gentle reader. 
<p>
If you have been programming for any length of time in a Unix environment,
you will have encountered the mystical programs Lex &amp; YACC, or as they
are known to GNU/Linux users worldwide, Flex &amp; Bison, where Flex is a
Lex implementation by Vern Paxon and Bison the GNU version of YACC. We will
call these programs Lex and YACC throughout - the newer versions are
upwardly compatible, so you can use Flex and Bison when trying our examples.

These programs are massively useful, but as with your C compiler, their
manpage does not explain the language they understand, nor how to use them.
YACC is really amazing when used in combination with Lex, however, the Bison
manpage does not describe how to integrate Lex generated code with your
Bison program.

<sect1>What this document is NOT
<p>
There are several great books which deal with Lex &amp; YACC. By all means
read these books if you need to know more. They provide far more information
than we ever will. See the 'Further Reading' section at the end. This
document is aimed at bootstrapping your use of Lex
&amp; YACC, to allow you to create your first programs.

The documentation that comes with Flex and BISON is also excellent, but no
tutorial. They do complement my HOWTO very well though. They too are
referenced at the end.

I am by no means a YACC/Lex expert. When I started writing this document, I
had exactly two days of experience. All I want to accomplish is to make
those two days easier for you.

In no way expect the HOWTO to show proper YACC and Lex style. Examples
have been kept very simple and there may be better ways to write them. If
you know how to, please let me know.

<sect>What Lex &amp; YACC can do for you
<p>
When properly used, these programs allow you to parse complex languages with
ease. This is a great boon when you want to read a configuration file, or
want to write a compiler for any language you (or anyone else) might have
invented.

With a little help, which this document will hopefully provide, you will
find that you will never write a parser again by hand - Lex &amp; YACC are
the tools to do this.

<sect1>What each program does on its own
<p>
Although these programs shine when used together, they each serve a
different purpose. The next chapter will explain what each part does.

<sect>Lex
<p>
The program Lex generates a so called `Lexer'. This is a function that takes
a stream of characters as its input, and whenever it sees a group of
characters that match a key, takes a certain action. A very simple example:

<tscreen><verb>
%{
#include <stdio.h>
%}

%%
stop	printf("Stop command received\n");
start	printf("Start command received\n");
%%

</verb></tscreen>

The first section, in between the %{ and %} pair is included directly in the
output program. We need this, because we use printf later on, which is
defined in stdio.h.

Sections are separated using '%%', so the first line of the second section
starts with the 'stop' key. Whenever the 'stop' key is encountered in the
input, the rest of the line (a printf() call) is executed.

Besides 'stop', we've also defined 'start', which otherwise does mostly the
same.

We terminate the code section with '%%' again. 

To compile Example 1, do this:
<tscreen><verb>
lex example1.l
cc lex.yy.c -o example1 -ll

</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen>
NOTE: If you are using flex, instead of lex, you may have to change '-ll' 
to '-lfl' in the compilation scripts. RedHat 6.x and SuSE need this, even when
you invoke 'flex' as 'lex'!
</tscreen>

This will generate the file 'example1'. If you run it, it waits for you to
type some input. Whenever you type something that is not matched by any of
the defined keys (ie, 'stop' and 'start') it's output again. If you 
enter 'stop' it will output 'Stop command received';

Terminate with a EOF (^D).

You may wonder how the program runs, as we didn't define a main() function.
This function is defined for you in libl (liblex) which we compiled in with
the -ll command.

<sect1>Regular expressions in matches
<p>
This example wasn't very useful in itself, and our next one won't be either.
It will however show how to use regular expressions in Lex, which are
massively useful later on.

Example 2:
<tscreen><verb>
%{
#include <stdio.h>
%}

%%
[0123456789]+		printf("NUMBER\n");
[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*	printf("WORD\n");
%%

</verb></tscreen>

This Lex file describes two kinds of matches (tokens): WORDs and NUMBERs.
Regular expressions can be pretty daunting but with only a little work it is
easy to understand them. Let's examine the NUMBER match:

[0123456789]+	

This says: a sequence of one or more characters from the group 0123456789.
We could also have written it shorter as:

[0-9]+

Now, the WORD match is somewhat more involved:

[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*

The first part matches 1 and only 1 character that is between 'a' and 'z',
or between 'A' and 'Z'. In other words, a letter. This initial letter then
needs to be followed by zero or more characters which are either a letter or
a digit. Why use an asterisk here? The '+' signifies 1 or more matches, but
a WORD might very well consist of only one character, which we've already
matched. So the second part may have zero matches, so we write a '*'.

This way, we've mimicked the behaviour of many programming languages which
demand that a variable name *must* start with a letter, but can contain
digits afterwards. In other words, 'temperature1' is a valid name, 
but '1temperature' is not.

Try compiling Example 2, lust like Example 1, and feed it some text. Here is
a sample session:

<tscreen><verb>
$ ./example2
foo
WORD

bar
WORD

123
NUMBER

bar123
WORD

123bar
NUMBER
WORD
</verb></tscreen>

You may also be wondering where all this whitespace is coming from in the
output. The reason is simple: it was in the input, and we don't match on it
anywhere, so it gets output again.

The Flex manpage documents its regular expressions in detail. Many people
feel that the perl regular expression manpage (perlre) is also very useful,
although Flex does not implement everything perl does.

Make sure that you do not create zero length matches like '[0-9]*' - your
lexer might get confused and start matching empty strings repeatedly.
<sect1>A more complicated example for a C like syntax
<p>
Let's say we want to parse a file that looks like this:
<tscreen><verb>
logging {
	category lame-servers { null; };
	category cname { null; };
};

zone "." {
        type hint;
        file "/etc/bind/db.root";
};
</verb></tscreen>

We clearly see a number of categories (tokens) in this file:
<itemize>
<item> WORDs, like 'zone' and 'type'
<item> FILENAMEs, like '/etc/bind/db.root'
<item> QUOTEs, like those surrounding the filename
<item> OBRACEs, {
<item> EBRACEs, }
<item> SEMICOLONs, ;
</itemize>

The corresponding Lex file is Example 3:
<tscreen><verb>
%{
#include <stdio.h>
%}

%%
[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*    printf("WORD ");
[a-zA-Z0-9\/.-]+        printf("FILENAME ");
\"                      printf("QUOTE ");
\{                      printf("OBRACE ");
\}                      printf("EBRACE ");
;                       printf("SEMICOLON ");
\n                      printf("\n");
[ \t]+                  /* ignore whitespace */;
%%

</verb></tscreen>

When we feed our file to the program this Lex file generates (using
example3.compile), we get:

<tscreen><verb>
WORD OBRACE 
WORD FILENAME OBRACE WORD SEMICOLON EBRACE SEMICOLON 
WORD WORD OBRACE WORD SEMICOLON EBRACE SEMICOLON 
EBRACE SEMICOLON 

WORD QUOTE FILENAME QUOTE OBRACE 
WORD WORD SEMICOLON 
WORD QUOTE FILENAME QUOTE SEMICOLON 
EBRACE SEMICOLON 
</verb></tscreen>

When compared with the configuration file mentioned above, it is clear that
we have neatly 'Tokenized' it. Each part of the configuration file has been
matched, and converted into a token.

And this is exactly what we need to put YACC to good use.

<sect1>What we've seen
<p>
We've seen that Lex is able to read arbitrary input, and determine what each
part of the input is. This is called 'Tokenizing'.

<sect>YACC
<p>
YACC can parse input streams consisting of tokens with certain values. This
clearly describes the relation YACC has with Lex, YACC has no idea 
what 'input streams' are, it needs preprocessed tokens. While you can write your
own Tokenizer, we will leave that entirely up to Lex.

A note on grammars and parsers. When YACC saw the light of day, the tool was
used to parse input files for compilers: programs. Programs written in a
programming language for computers are typically *not* ambiguous - they have
just one meaning. As such, YACC does not cope with ambiguity and will
complain about shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts. More about
ambiguity and YACC "problems" can be found in 'Conflicts' chapter.


<sect1>A simple thermostat controller
<p>
Let's say we have a thermostat that we want to control using a simple
language. A session with the thermostat may look like this:

<tscreen><verb>
heat on
	Heater on!
heat off
	Heater off!
target temperature 22
	New temperature set!
</verb></tscreen>

The tokens we need to recognize are: heat, on/off (STATE), target, temperature,
NUMBER.

The Lex tokenizer (Example 4) is:
<tscreen><verb>
%{
#include <stdio.h>
#include "y.tab.h"
%}
%%
[0-9]+                  return NUMBER;
heat                    return TOKHEAT;
on|off                  return STATE;
target                  return TOKTARGET;
temperature             return TOKTEMPERATURE;
\n                      /* ignore end of line */;
[ \t]+                  /* ignore whitespace */;
%%

</verb></tscreen>

We note two important changes. First, we include the file 'y.tab.h', and
secondly, we no longer print stuff, we return names of tokens. This change
is because we are now feeding it all to YACC, which isn't interested in
what we output to the screen. Y.tab.h has definitions for these tokens.

But where does y.tab.h come from? It is generated by YACC from the Grammar
File we are about to create. As our language is very basic, so is the grammar:

<tscreen><verb>
commands: /* empty */
        | commands command
        ;

command:
        heat_switch
        |
        target_set
        ;

heat_switch:
        TOKHEAT STATE
        {
         	printf("\tHeat turned on or off\n");
        }
        ;

target_set:
        TOKTARGET TOKTEMPERATURE NUMBER
        {
         	printf("\tTemperature set\n");
        }
        ;
</verb></tscreen>

The first part is what I call the 'root'. It tells us that we 
have 'commands', and that these commands consist of individual 'command'
parts. As you can see this rule is very recursive, because it again
contains the word 'commands'. What this means is that the program is now
capable of reducing a series of commands one by one. Read the chapter 'How
do Lex and YACC work internally' for important details on recursion.

The second rule defines what a command is. We support only two kinds of
commands, the 'heat_switch' and the 'target_set'. This is what the |-symbol
signifies - 'a command consists of either a heat_switch or a target_set'.

A heat_switch consists of the HEAT token, which is simply the word 'heat',
followed by a state (which we defined in the Lex file as 'on' or 'off').

Somewhat more complicated is the target_set, which consists of the TARGET
token (the word 'target'), the TEMPERATURE token (the word 'temperature')
and a number.

<sect2>A complete YACC file
<p>
The previous section only showed the grammar part of the YACC file, but
there is more. This is the header that we omitted:

<tscreen><verb>
%{
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
 
void yyerror(const char *str)
{
 	fprintf(stderr,"error: %s\n",str);
}
 
int yywrap()
{
 	return 1;
} 
  
main()
{
  	yyparse();
} 

%}

%token NUMBER TOKHEAT STATE TOKTARGET TOKTEMPERATURE
</verb></tscreen>
The yyerror() function is called by YACC if it finds an error. We simply
output the message passed, but there are smarter things to do. See 
the 'Further reading' section at the end.

The function yywrap() can be used to continue reading from another file. It
is called at EOF and you can than open another file, and return 0. Or you
can return 1, indicating that this is truly the end. For more about this,
see the 'How do Lex and YACC work internally' chapter.

Then there is the main() function, that does nothing but set everything in
motion.

The last line simply defines the tokens we will be using. These are output
using y.tab.h if YACC is invoked with the '-d' option.

<sect2>Compiling &amp; running the thermostat controller
<p>
<tscreen><verb>
lex example4.l
yacc -d example4.y
cc lex.yy.c y.tab.c -o example4 

</verb></tscreen>
A few things have changed. We now also invoke YACC to compile our grammar,
which creates y.tab.c and y.tab.h. We then call Lex as usual. When
compiling, we remove the -ll flag: we now have our own main() function and
don't need the one provided by libl.

<tscreen>NOTE: if you get an error about your compiler not being able to 
find 'yylval', add this to example4.l, just beneath #include
&lt;y.tab.h&gt;:
<verb>
extern YYSTYPE yylval;
</verb>
This is explained in the 'How Lex and YACC work internally' section.
</tscreen>

A sample session:
<tscreen><verb>
$ ./example4 
heat on
	Heat turned on or off
heat off
	Heat turned on or off
target temperature 10
	Temperature set
target humidity 20
error: parse error
$
</verb></tscreen>

This is not quite what we set out to achieve, but in the interest of keeping
the learning curve manageable, not all cool stuff can be presented at once.

<sect1>Expanding the thermostat to handle parameters
<p>
As we've seen, we now parse the thermostat commands correctly, and even flag
mistakes properly. But as you might have guessed by the weasely wording, the
program has no idea of what it should do, it does not get passed any of the
values you enter.

Let's start by adding the ability to read the new target temperature. In
order to do so, we need to learn the NUMBER match in the Lexer to convert
itself into an integer value, which can then be read in YACC.

Whenever Lex matches a target, it puts the text of the match in the
character string 'yytext'. YACC in turn expects to find a value in the
variable 'yylval'. In Example 5, we see the obvious solution:

<tscreen><verb>
%{
#include <stdio.h>
#include "y.tab.h"
%}
%%
[0-9]+                  yylval=atoi(yytext); return NUMBER;
heat                    return TOKHEAT;
on|off                  yylval=!strcmp(yytext,"on"); return STATE;
target                  return TOKTARGET;
temperature             return TOKTEMPERATURE;
\n                      /* ignore end of line */;
[ \t]+                  /* ignore whitespace */;
%%

</verb></tscreen>

As you can see, we run atoi() on yytext, and put the result in yylval, where
YACC can see it. We do much the same for the STATE match, where we compare
it to 'on', and set yylval to 1 if it is equal. Please note that having a
separate 'on' and 'off' match in Lex would produce faster code, but I wanted
to show a more complicated rule and action for a change.

Now we need to learn YACC how to deal with this. What is called 'yylval' in
Lex has a different name in YACC. Let's examine the rule setting the new
temperature target:

<tscreen><verb>
target_set: 
	TOKTARGET TOKTEMPERATURE NUMBER
	{
         	printf("\tTemperature set to %d\n",$3);
	}
        ;
</verb></tscreen>

To access the value of the third part of the rule (ie, NUMBER), we need to
use $3. Whenever yylex() returns, the contents of yylval are attached to the
terminal, the value of which can be accessed with the $-construct.

To expound on this further, let's observe the new 'heat_switch' rule:

<tscreen><verb>
heat_switch:
        TOKHEAT STATE
        {
         	if($2)
         	        printf("\tHeat turned on\n");
	 	else
                        printf("\tHeat turned off\n");
        }
        ;
</verb></tscreen>

If you now run example5, it properly outputs what you entered.

<sect1>Parsing a configuration file
<p>
Let's repeat part of the configuration file we mentioned earlier:
<tscreen><verb>
zone "." {
        type hint;
        file "/etc/bind/db.root";
};
</verb></tscreen>

Remember that we already wrote a Lexer for this file. Now all we need to do
is write the YACC grammar, and modify the Lexer so it returns values in 
a format YACC can understand.

In the lexer from Example 6 we see:
<tscreen><verb>
%{
#include <stdio.h>
#include "y.tab.h"
%}

%%

zone			return ZONETOK;
file			return FILETOK;
[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*    yylval=strdup(yytext); return WORD;
[a-zA-Z0-9\/.-]+        yylval=strdup(yytext); return FILENAME;
\"                      return QUOTE;
\{                      return OBRACE;
\}                      return EBRACE;
;                       return SEMICOLON;
\n                      /* ignore EOL */;
[ \t]+                  /* ignore whitespace */;
%%

</verb></tscreen>

If you look carefully, you can see that yylval has changed! We no longer
expect it to be an integer, but in fact assume that it is a char *. In the
interest of keeping things simple, we invoke strdup and waste a lot of
memory. Please note that this may not be a problem in many areas where you
only need to parse a file once, and then exit.

We want to store character strings because we are now mostly dealing with
names: file names and zone names. In a later chapter we will explain how to
deal with multiple types of data.

In order to tell YACC about the new type of yylval, we add this line to the
header of our YACC grammar:

<verb>#define YYSTYPE char *</verb>

The grammar itself is again more complicated. We chop it in parts to make it
easier to digest.

<tscreen><verb>
commands:
	|	 
	commands command SEMICOLON
	;


command:
	zone_set 
	;

zone_set:
	ZONETOK quotedname zonecontent
	{
		printf("Complete zone for '%s' found\n",$2);
	}
	;

</verb></tscreen>

This is the intro, including the aforementioned recursive 'root'. Please
note that we specify that commands are terminated (and separated) by ;'s. We
define one kind of command, the 'zone_set'. It consists of the ZONE token
(the word 'zone'), followed by a quoted name and the 'zonecontent'. This
zonecontent starts out simple enough:

<tscreen><verb>
zonecontent:
	OBRACE zonestatements EBRACE 

</verb></tscreen>

It needs to start with an OBRACE, a {. Then follow the zonestatements,
followed by an EBRACE, }.

<tscreen><verb>
quotedname:
        QUOTE FILENAME QUOTE
        {
         	$$=$2;
        }
</verb></tscreen>

This section defines what a 'quotedname' is: a FILENAME between QUOTEs.
Then it says something special: the value of a quotedname token is the value
of the FILENAME. This means that the quotedname has as its value the
filename without quotes.

This is what the magic '$$=$2;' command does. It says: my value is the value
of my second part. When the quotedname is now referenced in other rules, and
you access its value with the $-construct, you see the value that we set
here with $$=$2.

<tscreen>
NOTE: this grammar chokes on filenames without either a '.' or a '/' in
them.
</tscreen>


<tscreen><verb>
zonestatements:
	|
	zonestatements zonestatement SEMICOLON
	;

zonestatement:
	statements
	|
	FILETOK quotedname 
	{
		printf("A zonefile name '%s' was encountered\n", $2);
	}
	;

</verb></tscreen>

This is a generic statement that catches all kinds of statements within
the 'zone' block. We again see the recursiveness.

<tscreen><verb>
block: 
	OBRACE zonestatements EBRACE SEMICOLON
	;

statements:
	| statements statement
	;

statement: WORD | block | quotedname
</verb></tscreen>

This defines a block, and 'statements' which may be found within.

When executed, the output is like this:

<tscreen><verb>
$ ./example6
zone "." {
        type hint;
        file "/etc/bind/db.root";
        type hint;
};
A zonefile name '/etc/bind/db.root' was encountered
Complete zone for '.' found
</verb></tscreen>

<sect>Making a Parser in C++
<p>
Although Lex and YACC predate C++, it is possible to generate a C++ parser.
While Flex includes an option to generate a C++ lexer, we won't be using
that, as YACC doesn't know how to deal with it directly.

My preferred way to make a C++ parser is to have Lex generate a plain C
file, and to let YACC generate C++ code. When you then link your
application, you may run into some problems because the C++ code by default
won't be able to find C functions, unless you've told it that those
functions are extern "C".

To do so, make a C header in YACC like this:

<tscreen><verb>
extern "C"
{
 	int yyparse(void);
 	int yylex(void);  
 	int yywrap()
 	{
 	 	return 1;
        }

}
</verb></tscreen>

If you want to declare or change yydebug, you must now do it like this:

<tscreen><verb>
extern int yydebug;

main()
{
	yydebug=1;
	yyparse();
}
</verb></tscreen>

This is because C++'s One Definition Rule, which disallows multiple
definitions of yydebug.

You may also find that you need to repeat the #define of YYSTYPE in your Lex
file, because of C++'s stricter type checking. 

To compile, do something like this:
<tscreen><verb>
lex bindconfig2.l
yacc --verbose --debug -d bindconfig2.y -o bindconfig2.cc
cc -c lex.yy.c -o lex.yy.o
c++ lex.yy.o bindconfig2.cc -o bindconfig2 
</verb></tscreen>

Because of the -o statement, y.tab.h is now called bindconfig2.cc.h, so take
that into account.

To summarize: don't bother to compile your Lexer in C++, keep it in C. Make
your Parser in C++ and explain your compiler that some functions are C
functions with extern "C" statements.

<sect>How do Lex and YACC work internally
<p>
In the YACC file, you write your own main() function, which calls yyparse()
at one point. The function yyparse() is created for you by YACC, and ends up
in y.tab.c. 

yyparse() reads a stream of token/value pairs from yylex(), which needs to
be supplied. You can code this function yourself, or have Lex do it for you.
In our examples, we've chosen to leave this task to Lex.

The yylex() as written by Lex reads characters from a FILE * file pointer
called yyin. If you do not set yyin, it defaults to standard input. It
outputs to yyout, which if unset defaults to stdout. You can also modify
yyin in the yywrap() function which is called at the end of a file. It
allows you to open another file, and continue parsing.

If this is the case, have it return 0. If you want to end parsing at this
file, let it return 1.

Each call to yylex() returns an integer value which represents a token type.
This tells YACC what kind of token it has read. The token may optionally
have a value, which should be placed in the variable yylval.

By default yylval is of type int, but you can override that from the YACC
file by re#defining YYSTYPE.

The Lexer needs to be able to access yylval. In order to do so, it must be
declared in the scope of the lexer as an extern variable. The original YACC
neglects to do this for you, so you should add the following to your lexter,
just beneath #include &lt;y.tab.h&gt;:

<verb>
extern YYSTYPE yylval;
</verb>

Bison, which most people are using these days, does this for you
automatically.

<sect1>Token values
<p>
As mentioned before, yylex() needs to return what kind of token it
encountered, and put its value in yylval. When these tokens are defined with
the %token command, they are assigned numerical id's, starting from 256.

Because of that fact, it is possible to have all ascii characters as a
token. Let's say you are writing a calculator, up till now we would have
written the lexer like this:

<tscreen><verb>
[0-9]+          yylval=atoi(yytext); return NUMBER;
[ \n]+          /* eat whitespace */;
-               return MINUS;
\*              return MULT; 
\+              return PLUS;
...
</verb></tscreen>

Our YACC grammer would then contain:

<tscreen><verb>
	exp: 	NUMBER 
		|
		exp PLUS exp
		|
		exp MINUS exp
		|
		exp MULT exp
</verb></tscreen>

This is needlessly complicated. By using characters as shorthands for
numerical token id's, we can rewrite our lexer like this:

<verb>
[0-9]+          yylval=atoi(yytext); return NUMBER;
[ \n]+          /* eat whitespace */;
.               return (int) yytext[0];
</verb>

This last dot matches all single otherwise unmatched characters.

Our YACC grammer would then be:

<tscreen><verb>
	exp: 	NUMBER 
		|
		exp '+' exp
		|
		exp '-' exp
		|
		exp '*' exp
</verb></tscreen>

This is lots shorter and also more obvious. You do not need to declare these
ascii tokens with %token in the header, they work out of the box.

One other very good thing about this construct is that Lex will now match
everything we throw at it - avoiding the default behaviour of echoing
unmatched input to standard output. If a user of this calculator uses a ^,
for example, it will now generate a parsing error, instead of being echoed
to standard output.

<sect1>Recursion: 'right is wrong'
<p>
Recursion is a vital aspect of YACC. Without it, you can't specify that a
file consists of a sequence of independent commands or statements. Out of
its own accord, YACC is only interested in the first rule, or the one you
designate as the starting rule, with the '%start' symbol.

Recursion in YACC comes in two flavours: right and left. Left recursion,
which is the one you should use most of the time, looks like this:
<verb>
commands: /* empty */
	|
	commands command
</verb>
This says: a command is either empty, or it consists of more commands,
followed by a command. They way YACC works means that it can now easily chop
off individual command groups (from the front) and reduce them.

Compare this to right recursion, which confusingly enough looks better to
many eyes:
<verb>
commands: /* empty */
	|
	command commands
</verb>
But this is expensive. If used as the %start rule, it requires YACC to keep
all commands in your file on the stack, which may take a lot of memory. So
by all means, use left recursion when parsing long statements, like entire
files. Sometimes it is hard to avoid right recursion but if your statements
are not too long, you do not need to go out of your way to use left
recursion.

If you have something terminating (and therefore separating) your commands,
right recursion looks very natural, but is still expensive:
<verb>
commands: /* empty */
	|
	command SEMICOLON commands
</verb>

The right way to code this is using left recursion (I didn't invent this
either):
<verb>
commands: /* empty */
	|
	commands command SEMICOLON
</verb>

Earlier versions of this HOWTO mistakenly used right recursion. Markus
Triska kindly informed us of this.

<sect1>Advanced yylval: %union
<p>
Currently, we need to define *the* type of yylval. This however is not
always appropriate. There will be times when we need to be able to handle
multiple data types. Returning to our hypothetical thermostat, perhaps we
want to be able to choose a heater to control, like this:

<tscreen><verb>
heater mainbuiling
	Selected 'mainbuilding' heater
target temperature 23
	'mainbuilding' heater target temperature now 23
</verb></tscreen>

What this calls for is for yylval to be a union, which can hold both strings
and integers - but not simultaneously.

Remember that we told YACC previously what type yylval was supposed to by by
defining YYSTYPE. We could conceivably define YYSTYPE to be a union this
way, by YACC has an easier method for doing this: the %union statement.

Based on Example 4, we now write the Example 7 YACC grammar. First the
intro:
<tscreen><verb>
%token TOKHEATER TOKHEAT TOKTARGET TOKTEMPERATURE

%union 
{
        int number;
        char *string;
}

%token <number> STATE
%token <number> NUMBER
%token <string> WORD
</verb></tscreen>

We define our union, which contains only a number and a string. Then using
an extended %token syntax, we explain to YACC which part of the union each
token should access.

In this case, we let the STATE token use an integer, as before. Same goes
for the NUMBER token, which we use for reading temperatures.

New however is the WORD token, which is declared to need a string.

The Lexer file changes a bit too:
<tscreen><verb>
%{
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include "y.tab.h"
%}
%%
[0-9]+                  yylval.number=atoi(yytext); return NUMBER;
heater			return TOKHEATER;
heat                    return TOKHEAT;
on|off                  yylval.number=!strcmp(yytext,"on"); return STATE;
target                  return TOKTARGET;
temperature             return TOKTEMPERATURE;
[a-z0-9]+		yylval.string=strdup(yytext);return WORD;
\n                      /* ignore end of line */;
[ \t]+                  /* ignore whitespace */;
%%

</verb></tscreen>

As you can see, we don't access the yylval directly anymore, we add a suffix
indicating which part we want to access. We don't need to do that in the
YACC grammar however, as YACC performs the magic for us:

<tscreen><verb>
heater_select:
        TOKHEATER WORD
	{
	 	printf("\tSelected heater '%s'\n",$2);
        	heater=$2;
	}
        ;
</verb></tscreen>

Because of the %token declaration above, YACC automatically picks 
the 'string' member from our union. Note also that we store a copy of $2,
which is later used to tell the user which heater he is sending commands to:

<tscreen><verb>
target_set:
        TOKTARGET TOKTEMPERATURE NUMBER
        {
	 	printf("\tHeater '%s' temperature set to %d\n",heater,$3);
  	}
	;
</verb></tscreen>

For more details, read example7.y.

<sect>Debugging
<p>
Especially when learning, it is important to have debugging facilities.
Luckily, YACC can give a lot of feedback. This feedback comes at the cost of
some overhead, so you need to supply some switches to enable it.

When compiling your grammar, add --debug and --verbose to the YACC
commandline. In your grammar C heading, add the following:

	int yydebug=1;

This will generate the file 'y.output' which explains the state machine that
was created.

When you now run the generated binary, it will output a *lot* of what is
happening. This includes what state the state machine currently has, and
what tokens are being read.

Peter Jinks wrote a page on <URL
URL="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pjj/cs2121/debug.html" name="debugging"> which
contains some common errors and how to solve them.

<sect1>The state machine
<p>
Internally, your YACC parser runs a so called 'state machine'. As the name
implies, this is a machine that can be in several states. Then there are
rules which govern transitions from one state to another. Everything starts
with the so called 'root' rule I mentioned earlier.

To quote from the output from the Example 7 y.output:
<tscreen><verb>
state 0

    ZONETOK     , and go to state 1

    $default    reduce using rule 1 (commands)

    commands    go to state 29
    command     go to state 2
    zone_set    go to state 3
</verb></tscreen>

By default, this state reduces using the 'commands' rule. This is the
aforementioned recursive rule that defines 'commands' to be built up from
individual command statements, followed by a semicolon, followed by possibly
more commands.

This state reduces until it hits something it understands, in this case, a
ZONETOK, ie, the word 'zone'. It then goes to state 1, which deals further
with a zone command:

<tscreen><verb>
state 1

    zone_set  ->  ZONETOK . quotedname zonecontent   (rule 4)

    QUOTE       , and go to state 4

    quotedname  go to state 5
</verb></tscreen>

The first line has a '.' in it to indicate where we are: we've just seen a
ZONETOK and are now looking for a 'quotedname'. Apparently, a quotedname
starts with a QUOTE, which sends us to state 4.

To follow this further, compile Example 7 with the flags mentioned in the
Debugging section.

<sect1>Conflicts: 'shift/reduce', 'reduce/reduce' 
<p>
Whenever YACC warns you about conflicts, you may be in for trouble. Solving
these conflicts appears to be somewhat of an art form that may teach you a
lot about your language. More than you possibly would have wanted to know.

The problems revolve around how to interpret a sequence of tokens. Let's
suppose we define a language that needs to accept both these commands:

<tscreen><verb>
	delete heater all
	delete heater number1
</verb></tscreen>

To do this, we define this grammar:

<tscreen><verb>
	delete_heaters:
		TOKDELETE TOKHEATER mode
		{
			deleteheaters($3);
		}
	
	mode:	WORD

	delete_a_heater:
		TOKDELETE TOKHEATER WORD
		{
			delete($3);
		}
</verb></tscreen>

You may already be smelling trouble. The state machine starts by reading the
word 'delete', and then needs to decide where to go based on the next token.
This next token can either be a mode, specifying how to delete the heaters,
or the name of a heater to delete.

The problem however is that for both commands, the next token is going to be
a WORD. YACC has therefore no idea what to do. This leads to 
a 'reduce/reduce' warning, and a further warning that the 'delete_a_heater'
node is never going to be reached.

In this case the conflict is resolved easily (ie, by renaming the first
command to 'delete heaters all', or by making 'all' a separate token), but
sometimes it is harder. The y.output file generated when you pass yacc the
--verbose flag can be of tremendous help.

<sect>Further reading
<p>
GNU YACC (Bison) comes with a very nice info-file (.info) which documents
the YACC syntax very well. It mentions Lex only once, but otherwise it's
very good. You can read .info files with Emacs or with the very nice 
tool 'pinfo'. It is also available on the GNU site: 
<URL name="BISON Manual" URL="http://www.gnu.org/manual/bison/">.

Flex comes with a good manpage which is very useful if you already
have a rough understanding of what Flex does. The
<URL name="Flex Manual" URL="http://www.gnu.org/manual/flex/"> is also
available online.

After this introduction to Lex and YACC, you may find that you need more
information. I haven't read any of these books yet, but they sound good:
