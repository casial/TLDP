<sect>Introduction

<p>
To get a working printer/fax on the linux machine you should have
some software and fax modem.
<p>
The Printing software will be using the fax software as a print filter.
The efax will find the fax number from the print Job number and will send the fax.
The efax software was written be Ed Casas &lt;edc@cce.com&gt;.
<p>
The rest of the document is build as Q&amp;A.

<sect>Questions &amp; Answers
<sect1> What is a fax printer server ?
<p> A fax printer server is a setup of few programs:
    efax, and the print server, in such a way that sending a fax from
    the computer is as simple as sending printout to a printer.

<sect1> How to set it up ?
<p>
Setting efax as fax print server includes few problems
As I worked it out few times, I decided to collect this wisdom
in this small mini-HOWTO, comments are welcome at <tt/&lt;erez@newplaces.com&gt;/.
I describe them here and the solutions, and all the instruction in short steps:

<sect2>The efax Software
<p>
make sure you have the efax package.
<p>
      On RPM based system use the command 'rpm -qv efax'.
<p>
      You can get the efax sources in tar.gz format from sunsite:
      ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/serialcomm/fax/efax08a.tar.gz
      or binary rpm package:
      ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/redhat-4.2/i386/RedHat/RPMS/efax-0.8a-3.i386.rpm
<sect2> The printcap entry.
<p>
The efax documentation is missing the :  at the end of the printcap entry.
<p>Solution: Add the following <tt>/etc/printcap</tt> entry:

<tscreen><verb>
fax:\
        :lp=/dev/null:\
        :sd=/var/spool/fax:\
        :if=/usr/bin/faxlpr:
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>The fax command
<p> Use hard link and not symbolic link to the fax command.
<p>Run the command:
<tscreen><verb>
ln /usr/bin/fax /usr/bin/faxlpr
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>The /usr/bin/fax file.
<p> Edit the /usr/bin/fax to your preferences:
<p> choose the right Fax Class for your modem:
<tscreen><verb>
CLASS=2.0
</verb></tscreen>
Set the FROM="your international phone number" field
<tscreen><verb>
NAME="Your Name"
</verb></tscreen>
Add the line for conversion of international phone number to local
for example in Israel you would use:
<tscreen><verb>
TELCVT='sed -e s/+972/0/ -e s/+/00/'  # Israel
</verb></tscreen>

There is a problem in the file in line 586, change the
<tt/cfile=.../ with the following two lines:

<tscreen><verb>
cfile=`/usr/bin/tail -1 lock`
cfile=`cat $cfile`
</verb></tscreen>

   at lines 586,587 there shouldn't be '-' signs the lines are:

<tscreen><verb>
0) echo "$l" | mail -s "fax to $num succeeded" $user@$host ;;
*) echo "$l" | mail -s "fax to $num failed   " $user@$host ;;
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>The /var/spool/fax directory.
<p> create the directory /var/spool/fax
<tscreen><verb>
mkdir /var/spool/fax
chmod 777 /var/spool/fax
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2> The lock file.
<p>The lock file (<tt>/var/spool/fax/lock</tt>) is being created with
     incorrect permissions, use the following command to set it correctly:

<tscreen><verb>
touch /var/spool/fax/lock ; chmod 644 /var/spool/fax/lock
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2> The /dev/modem special file.
<p>
The efax program is expecting real device file at the <tt>/dev/modem</tt>
and will not work with symbolic link, so create a device file
with the same major and minor number as the <tt>/dev/cua?</tt> the is
connected to the modem. The file should have the rw-rw-rw- mode to enable
any user to use the fax software.
  
<tscreen><verb>
ls -lL /dev/modem 
rm /dev/modem
mknod /dev/modem c Mj Mi
chmod 666 /dev/modem
</verb></tscreen>

Mj is 5, and Mi is 64 for the cua0, 65 for cua1 and so on.
For example (for cua1):

<tscreen><verb>
mknod /dev/modem c 5 65
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2> The <tt>/var/lock</tt> directory.
<p>change the mode at the <tt>/var/lock</tt> directory

<tscreen><verb>
chmod 1777 /var/lock
</verb></tscreen>


<sect1> How do I use it, for the server ?
<p>
 You should use the fax printer using the -P option
    and the -J option with the fax number.

    use one of the following lpr commands:
    
<tscreen><verb>
 lpr -Pfax -J <Fax-Number> [file-names]
 any command | lpr -Pfax -J <Fax-Number>
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Where do I specify the target Fax number ?
<p>
After the -J option.
</p>

<sect1>How do I use it from other Unixes on the net ?
<p>
Add the following entry into the <tt>/etc/printcap</tt> file and the client
    Linux systems, create the spool directory, and so on ...

<tscreen><verb>
fax:\
        :sd=/var/spool/fax:\
        :mx#0:\
        :sh:\
        :rm=host.domain:\
        :rp=fax:
</verb></tscreen>

 add the name of the client hosts into the <tt>/etc/hosts.lpd</tt> on the
 fax server machine.

<p>
 use it as before.

<p>
Note:

 The header string that efax adds to the fax pages is not effected
 by the user name that sends the fax. (can be updated).
</p>

<sect1>Caldera, LPRng users
<p> The LPRng printing management software is using a different method to handle the control file.
<p>Thanks to Luca Montecchiani &lt;m.luca@usa.net&gt;, who found the problem and the solution.
Here is an update to the <tt>/usr/bin/fax</tt> file. The following line replace the two simple <bf/cfile=.../ lines at lines 586,587

<tscreen><verb>
# Modified to work also with the LPRng package
# Luca Montecchiani (08/11/97 m.luca@usa.net)
if [ !-z "$CONTROL_FILE" ]
    then
        cfile=`cat tail -1 lock`
        cfile=`cat $cfile`
    else
        cfile=$CONTROL_FILE
fi                                       
</verb></tscreen>
