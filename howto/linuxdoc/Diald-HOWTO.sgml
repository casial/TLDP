<sect>Introduction

<sect1>Objectives
<p>

This document shows some typical scenarios for easy start using
<em/Diald/.
These scenarios include a connection from a standalone computer to an ISP
using PPP over a modem without using <tt>pon/poff</tt> or
<tt>ppp-on/ppp-off</tt> to a proxy/firewall server with different Internet
connections through various ISPs.

In the present document, the following scenarios will be treated:
<itemize>
<item>Connecting a standalone computer to an ISP using a modem and PPP
<item>Conecting a computer to a group of different ISPs with a modem and PPP
<item>Connecting a proxy/firewall to an ISP using a modem and PPP
</itemize>

In following versions of this document, other scenarios will be added, as
multiple instances of <em/Diald/, ISDN lines and lines used to call and
receive calls.

Before this document, a Diald-mini-Howto exist, wrote by Harish Pillay
<tt><htmlurl url="mailto:h.pillay@ieee.org"
name="h.pillay@ieee.org"></tt>, that presented and example of connection
to an ISP using a chat based authentication scheme (login and password
previous to the pppd start, with no use of PAP or CHAP).

Example configuration files will be included in this document to serve as
starting point to get <em/Diald/ up. To obtain maximum performance and all
programs attributes, it is necesary you read all documentation from the
programs and reconfigure the example configuration files included here.

Finally, configuration files can be in different directories depending on
what GNU/Linux distribution you are using. If you find a file commented
here in other directory, please, write me.

<sect1>New versions

<sect>Quick Diald operation description
<p>

In a few words, <em/Diald/ creates a new network interface and sets it as
the default gateway. This interface is not real (in the original
documentation it is called <tt/proxy interface/). <em/Diald/ monitors this
interface, and, when packets arrive, makes a <tt/ppp/ connection, waits
for it to be stablished and changes the default gateway to this new
<tt/ppp/ interface (usually <tt/ppp0/).

<em/Diald/ monitors the interface to determine which packets have been
received the interface and their types to decide if they are going to be
considered to set the <tt/ppp/ connection up, maintain the link, drop it
or do nothing, and how long the link should be help up after the packet is
transmitted.

Finally, if there is no more traffic and the last packet up time is over,
<em/Diald/ will close the link.
 
You can control days and hours when the link can go up and when it cannot,
so you can use the low cost hours/days or low trafic times.

This previous description is valid for <em/Diald/ versions from 0.16.5 to
latest (0.99.3 when this document was finished), but latest versions also
include aditional attributes such as user enabled list, advanced
accounting, better support for ISDN lines, better performance using an
<tt/ethertap/ device as proxy (this is like a network interface that
read/writes over a socket instead of a real network adapter) in place of
<tt/slip/, backup connections and other functions.

<sect>Note about authentication
<p>

When you connect to an Internet Services Provider, it is usually
necesary that you send an username and a password. This can be
accomplished using several methods; the exact method that you use is
determined by your provider.

Added to the three shown options, you can use a link without
authentication, (generally when the remote end is also yours).

<sect1>Username and password - Login and password prompts.
<p>

Actually, this is not an usual authentication method to access the
Internet through an ISP.

Identification is made before <tt/pppd/ is started, and it is the dialer,
usually <tt/chat/, who sends the login name and the password. This
data is sent in plaintext, so this method should not be considered secure.

An example script for <tt/chat/ where you can see how to specify username
and password to be sent before running <tt/pppd/ would look something like
this:

<tscreen><verb>
ABORT BUSY
ABORT "NO CARRIER"
ABORT VOICE
ABORT "NO DIALTONE" 
ABORT "NO ANSWER"
"" ATZ
OK ATDT_TelephoneNumber_
CONNECT \d\c
ogin _Username_
assword _Password_
</verb></tscreen>

The last 2 lines define username and password, and when to send it (after
receiving «ogin» and «assword» respectively.  The chat script only needs
to see parts of the words «login» and «password» and so we don't check the
first letter of each.  This is so that we don't need to worry about
uppercase/lowercase characters.

Suppose that this script is called <tt/provider/, and it is saved into
the <tt>/etc/chatscripts</tt> directory. Then, you can run it with:

<tscreen><verb>
/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/chatscripts/provider
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>PAP - Password Authentication Protocol
<p>

If the provider you are using requires PAP as the authentication protocol,
during the LCP negotiation in PPP this protocol will be asked to use this
protocol. When the phone call is connected after using <tt/chat/,
<tt/pppd/ is started. In this scenario, pppd will send the username and
the password, which it will look for in the <tt>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</tt>
file. This file must have read and write permissions only for <tt/root/
only, so that nobody else can read the passwords inside it.

PAP is not very secure, as the password is sent in plaintext, so can be
read by somebody that monitors your transmission line.

Simple example of <tt>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</tt>:

<tscreen><verb>
_Username_ * _Password_
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>CHAP - Challenge Authentication Protocol
<p>

If the provider you are using requires CHAP as the authentication protocol,
during the LCP negotiation in PPP this protocol will be asked to use this
protocol. When the phone call is connected after using <tt/chat/,
<tt/pppd/ is started. In this scenario, pppd will send the username and
the password, which it will look for in the <tt>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</tt>
file. This file must have read and write permissions only for <tt/root/
only, so that nobody else can read the passwords inside it.

CHAP is more secure than PAP, as the password is never sent through the
transmission line in plaintext. The authentication server sends a random
identifier (the challenge), that the client must encrypt with its
password, and then send back to the server.

Simple example of <tt>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</tt>:

<tscreen><verb>
_Username_ * _Password_
</verb></tscreen>

Sometimes an ISP uses PAP and other times CHAP, so it is common to define
your username and password in both files.

<sect>Notes about DNS name resolution
<p>

Everytime you connect to an ISP, it is necesary to have configured DNS
name resolution, so your computer can find IP addresses associated to a
computer name.

IP addresses of your DNS servers are placed into the
<tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> file.

In a standalone computer connecting to Internet, this file usually
contains the IP addresses of your ISP's DNS servers:

<tscreen><verb>
#/etc/resolv.conf file for ISPname
nameserver 111.222.333.444
nameserver 222.333.444.555
</verb></tscreen>

In a proxy/firewall computer, this file usually contains its own IP
address (or the loopback address, 127.0.0.1), and this computer includes a
DNS server that translates DNS names to IP addresses by querying external
DNS servers.

<tscreen><verb>
#/etc/resolv.conf file for local DNS resolution
nameserver 127.0.0.1
</verb></tscreen>

Installation of a local DNS server is out of the scope of this document.
There is a lot of documentation about this, but a good and quick approach
can be found in the DNS-Howto (<tt><htmlurl
url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/DNS-HOWTO.html"
name="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/DNS-HOWTO.html"></tt>).

<sect>Connecting a standalone computer to an ISP using a modem and PPP
<p>

When configuring <em/Diald/ to connect your computer to an ISP, the next
steps will be necesary:
<itemize>
<item>Getting the <em/Diald/ package installed. The quickest way is to
install the package that comes with your GNU/Linux distribution.
<item>Configure DNS resolver (<tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> file).
<item>Check that you can call an ISP. If your GNU/Linux distribution
includes an utility to configure a connection, the quickest way will be to
use it (pppconfig in Debian, kppp if you use KDE, etc). If you are having
problems connecting to an ISP, the PPP-Howto (<tt><htmlurl
url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/PPP-HOWTO.html"
name="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/PPP-HOWTO.html"></tt>), Modem-Howto
(<tt><htmlurl url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Modem-HOWTO.html"
name="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Modem-HOWTO.html"></tt>) and
Serial-Howto (<tt><htmlurl
url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Serial-HOWTO.html"
name="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Serial-HOWTO.html"></tt>) documents
can help you.
<item>Configure username and password in the <tt>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</tt>
and <tt>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</tt> files, as mentioned in previous
sections.
</itemize>

And finally, going into <em/Diald/:

<itemize>
<item>Prepare the <em/Diald/ configuration file
(<tt>/etc/diald/diald.options</tt> for version 0.16.5 and
<tt>/etc/diald/diald.conf</tt> for later versions).
<item>Prepare filters file <tt>/etc/diald/standard.filter</tt>,
or better, leave that file as is, and modify a copy of it that you can
call <tt>/etc/diald/personal.filter</tt>.
<item>Prepare the script to make the call
(<tt>/etc/diald/diald.connect</tt> with execute permissions for root) and
instruction file for <tt/chat/ (<tt>/etc/chatscripts/provider</tt>), that
will be used by the previous script.
<item>Prepare scripts to be run when the link goes up and down
(<tt>/etc/diald/ip-up</tt> and <tt>/etc/diald/ip-down</tt>) if you want to
use it (both must have execute permissions for root).
<item>Prepare script to set and delete routes
(<tt>/etc/diald/addroute</tt> and <tt>/etc/diald/delroute</tt>) if you
want (both must have execute permissions for root). This step is not necesary
if you only use a single <em/Diald/ instance.
<item>Finally, start the <tt>diald</tt> daemon
(«<tt>/etc/init.d/diald start</tt>» in Debian,
«<tt>/etc/rc.d/init.d/diald start</tt>» in RedHat).
Normally, <em/Diald/ package installation process prepares the scripts to
run <em/Diald/ when the computer boot up in the /etc/rcX.d directories.
</itemize>

If you make any change in the <em/Diald/ config file when it is running,
it is necesary to restart it («<tt>/etc/init.d/diald restart</tt>» in
Debian, «<tt>/etc/rc.d/init.d/diald restart</tt>» in RedHat).

<sect1>/etc/diald/diald.options or diald.conf file
<p>

In this example file you must check for:
<itemize>
<item>Comm port where your modem is connected. Option <tt/device/.
<item>Comm port speed to talk with modem. Option <tt/speed/.
<item>User name to be used in ppp. Option <tt/pppd-options/.
<item>Retry counters and timers.
<item>Enabled connection hours. Options <tt/restrict/.
<item>Decide if you want to use the <tt/ip-up/ and <tt/ip-down/ scripts.
Options <tt/ip-up/ and <tt/ip-down/.
<item>Decide if you want to use the <tt/addroute/ and <tt/delroute/
scripts. Options <tt/addroute/ and <tt/delroute/. Generally it is not
needed to modify this scripts, but if you use more than one instance of
<em/Diald/ or have a complex configuration, you need it.
<item>Decide if you use the standar or personal filter file. Options
<tt/include/.
</itemize>

<sect1>Personal filters file
<p>

Manipulation of this file must be done very carefully. This file is used
to decide when and why to start up the line, maintain it, bring down the
line or ignore a packet, depending on the traffic type.

Generally, the <em/Diald/ standar filter file is sufficient for most
cases, but perhaps, it may be too restrictive or not restrictive enough in
some situations. The <tt/personal.filter/ file that is shown has some
corrections over the original from the 0.16 version.

In next versions of this document, other commented more restrictive
examples will be included.

<tscreen><verb>
# /etc/diald/personal.filter
# Filter rules shown are the same as in the standard.filter with the
# following changes:
#
# Change 10 to 4 minuttes in "any other tcp conection".
# Added "ignore tcp tcp.fin" to ignore the FIN ACK packets.
# Ignore icmp packets (ping and traceroute don't fire up the interface).
#

# This is a pretty complicated set of filter rules.
# (These are the rules I use myself.)
#
# I've divided the rules up into four sections.
# TCP packets, UDP packets, ICMP packets and a general catch all rule
# at the end.

ignore icmp any

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rules for TCP packets.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# General comments on the rule set:
#
# In general we would like to treat only data on a TCP link as significant
# for timeouts. Therefore, we try to ignore packets with no data.
# Since the shortest possible set of headers in a TCP/IP packet is 40 bytes,
# any packet with length 40 must have no data riding in it.
# We may miss some empty packets this way (optional routing information
# and other extras may be present in the IP header), but we should get
# most of them. Note that we don't want to filter out packets with
# tcp.live clear, since we use them later to speedup disconnects
# on some TCP links.
#
# We also want to make sure WWW packets live even if the TCP socket
# is shut down. We do this because WWW doesn't keep connections open
# once the data has been transfered, and it would be annoying to have the link
# keep bouncing up and down every time you get a document.
#
# Outside of WWW the most common use of TCP is for long lived connections,
# that once they are gone mean we no longer need the network connection.
# We don't neccessarily want to wait 10 minutes for the connection
# to go down when we don't have any telnet's or rlogin's running,
# so we want to speed up the timeout on TCP connections that have
# shutdown. We do this by catching packets that do not have the live flag set.

# --- start of rule set proper ---

# When initiating a connection we only give the link 15 seconds initially.
# The idea here is to deal with possibility that the network on the opposite
# end of the connection is unreachable. In this case you don't really
# want to give the link 10 minutes up time. With the rule below
# we only give the link 15 seconds initially. If the network is reachable
# then we will normally get a response that actually contains some
# data within 15 seconds. If this causes problems because you have a slow
# response time at some site you want to regularly access, you can either
# increase the timeout or remove this rule.
accept tcp 15 tcp.syn

# Keep named xfers from holding the link up
ignore tcp tcp.dest=tcp.domain
ignore tcp tcp.source=tcp.domain

# (Ack! SCO telnet starts by sending empty SYNs and only opens the
# connection if it gets a response. Sheesh..)
accept tcp 5 ip.tot_len=40,tcp.syn

# keep empty packets from holding the link up (other than empty SYN packets)
ignore tcp ip.tot_len=40,tcp.live

# Modification by Andres Seco to ignore the FIN ACK packets.
ignore tcp tcp.fin

# make sure http transfers hold the link for 2 minutes, even after they end.
# NOTE: Your /etc/services may not define the tcp service www, in which
# case you should comment out the following two lines or get a more
# up to date /etc/services file. See the FAQ for information on obtaining
# a new /etc/services file.
accept tcp 120 tcp.dest=tcp.www
accept tcp 120 tcp.source=tcp.www
# Same for https
accept tcp 120 tcp.dest=tcp.443
accept tcp 120 tcp.source=tcp.443

# Once the link is no longer live, we try to shut down the connection
# quickly. Note that if the link is already down, a state change
# will not bring it back up.
keepup tcp 5 !tcp.live
ignore tcp !tcp.live

# an ftp-data or ftp connection can be expected to show reasonably frequent
# traffic.
accept tcp 120 tcp.dest=tcp.ftp
accept tcp 120 tcp.source=tcp.ftp

#NOTE: ftp-data is not defined in the /etc/services file provided with
# the latest versions of NETKIT, so I've got this commented out here.
# If you want to define it add the following line to your /etc/services:
# ftp-data        20/tcp
# and uncomment the following two rules.
#accept tcp 120 tcp.dest=tcp.ftp-data
#accept tcp 120 tcp.source=tcp.ftp-data

# If we don't catch it above, give the link 10 minutes up time.
#accept tcp 600 any
# Modificacion de Andres Seco. Solo dejar 4 minutos mas.
accept tcp 240 any

# Rules for UDP packets
#
# We time out domain requests right away, we just want them to bring
# the link up, not keep it around for very long.
# This is because the network will usually come up on a call
# from the resolver library (unless you have all your commonly
# used addresses in /etc/hosts, in which case you will discover
# other problems.)
# Note that you should not make the timeout shorter than the time you
# might expect your DNS server to take to respond. Otherwise
# when the initial link gets established there might be a delay
# greater than this between the initial series of packets before
# any packets that keep the link up longer pass over the link.

# Don't bring the link up for rwho.
ignore udp udp.dest=udp.who
ignore udp udp.source=udp.who
# Don't bring the link up for RIP.
ignore udp udp.dest=udp.route
ignore udp udp.source=udp.route
# Don't bring the link up for NTP or timed.
ignore udp udp.dest=udp.ntp
ignore udp udp.source=udp.ntp
ignore udp udp.dest=udp.timed
ignore udp udp.source=udp.timed
# Don't bring up on domain name requests between two running nameds.
ignore udp udp.dest=udp.domain,udp.source=udp.domain
# Bring up the network whenever we make a domain request from someplace
# other than named.
accept udp 30 udp.dest=udp.domain 
accept udp 30 udp.source=udp.domain
# Do the same for netbios-ns broadcasts
# NOTE: your /etc/services file may not define the netbios-ns service
# in which case you should comment out the next three lines.
ignore udp udp.source=udp.netbios-ns,udp.dest=udp.netbios-ns
accept udp 30 udp.dest=udp.netbios-ns
accept udp 30 udp.source=udp.netbios-ns
# keep routed and gated transfers from holding the link up
ignore udp tcp.dest=udp.route
ignore udp tcp.source=udp.route
# Anything else gest 2 minutes.

# Catch any packets that we didn't catch above and give the connection

cost for routing):

<tscreen><verb>

</verb></tscreen>

<sect>Conecting a computer to a group of different ISPs with a modem and PPP
<p>

Many times, one standalone computer does not only connect to just one
network. It is common to connect to different networks or to the Internet
using some different service providers. In this case, changing
configuration files each time you want to connect to a different site can
be annoying.

The solution i propose here consist in using different sets of
configuration files for each different connection. You can find here some
scripts to automate changing from one to another.

<sect1>Note about sending mail using a relay host
<p>

If your email client program uses a local Message Transfer Agent with a
<tt/smtp/ relay host to send all messages, or if you use a email client
program that sends the messages directly to your provider's <tt/smtp/
server, changing where you are connecting means you need to reconfigure
this option for the <tt/smtp/ relay server. This is because the providers
usually check if the receipt mailbox is local or to any domain directly
maintained by this provider or if the origin ip address is from the range
of ip addresses that this provider assigns, to avoid having an open relay
server that can be used to send spam, anonymous message and so on.  

In the following examples, you will find how to change this parameter in
the <em/Smail/ configuration files in a simple configuration where all
external messages are sent to a <tt/smtp/ relay server. If you use another
Message Transfer Agent (MTA) in your system, you can send me what you must
change in your MTA to include it here. If you use an email client program
that directly sends to the external <tt/smtp/ server (Kmail, Netscape,
etc.) send me your changes too.

<sect1>Scripts to automate multiple connections and changing from one to another

<sect2>Starting up
<p>

First of all, create a subdirectory of <tt>/etc/diald</tt> called
<tt/providers/ where you store your scripts to automatically change from
one to another provider and the subdirectories with the set of files to
configure each of the providers connections.

With the next script this directory is created and filled with the
current configuration files from <em/Diald/, <em/chat/, <em/pppd/ and
<em/Smail/, that will be treated as a template for the next
configurations.

<tscreen><verb>
#!/bin/sh
#File /etc/diald/providers/setupdialdmultiprovider
mkdir /etc/diald/providers
mkdir /etc/diald/providers/setup
cp /etc/ppp/pap-secrets /etc/diald/providers/setup
cp /etc/ppp/chap-secrets /etc/diald/providers/setup
cp /etc/resolv.conf /etc/diald/providers/setup
cp /etc/diald/diald.options /etc/diald/providers/setup
cp /etc/diald/standard.filter /etc/diald/providers/setup
cp /etc/diald/personal.filter /etc/diald/providers/setup
cp /etc/diald/diald.connect /etc/diald/providers/setup
cp /etc/chatscripts/provider /etc/diald/providers/setup
cp /etc/diald/ip-up /etc/diald/providers/setup
cp /etc/diald/ip-down /etc/diald/providers/setup
cp /etc/smail/routers /etc/diald/providers/setup
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>New provider
<p>

With the next script the template configuration will be copied to a new
directory to prepare it for a new provider connection or a new net
connection. This script (<tt>/etc/diald/providers/newdialdprovider</tt>)
will need a parameter with the provider or net name.

<tscreen><verb>
#!/bin/sh
#File /etc/diald/providers/newdialdprovider
mkdir /etc/diald/providers/$1
cp /etc/diald/providers/setup/* /etc/diald/providers/$1
</verb></tscreen>

Now, you will modify as you need the new files in
<tt>/etc/diald/providers/provdidername</tt>, being <tt>providername</tt>
the parameter passed to <tt>newdialdprovider</tt>.

<sect2>Changing from one to another
<p>

At the end, with this script you will change all your configuration files
related to <em/Diald/ to connect to another provider or net. I use
symbolic links to avoid using duplicate files. Using symbolic links, if
you change any config file in its original location like
<tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt>, the change is really made in the 
<tt>/etc/diald/providers/providername/resolv.conf</tt> file.

<tscreen><verb>
#!/bin/sh
#File /etc/diald/providers/setdialdprovider
/etc/init.d/diald stop
#wait for Diald to stop.
sleep 4
ln -sf /etc/diald/providers/$1/pap-secrets /etc/ppp
ln -sf /etc/diald/providers/$1/chap-secrets /etc/ppp
ln -sf /etc/diald/providers/$1/resolv.conf /etc
ln -sf /etc/diald/providers/$1/diald.options /etc/diald
ln -sf /etc/diald/providers/$1/standard.filter /etc/diald
ln -sf /etc/diald/providers/$1/personal.filter /etc/diald
ln -sf /etc/diald/providers/$1/diald.connect /etc/diald
ln -sf /etc/diald/providers/$1/provider /etc/chatscripts
ln -sf /etc/diald/providers/$1/ip-up /etc/diald
ln -sf /etc/diald/providers/$1/ip-down /etc/diald
ln -sf /etc/diald/providers/$1/routers /etc/smail
/etc/init.d/diald start
</verb></tscreen>

<sect>Connecting a proxy/firewall to an ISP using a modem and PPP
<p>

Connecting a private net to the Internet with dedicated server which
handles packet routing from the local network to the Internet along with
proxy/caching services and security firewalling is a complex theme that is
beyond the scope of this document. There are other «Howto» documents that
handle these topics much more comprehensively. At the end of this
document you can find a list of links and references to such documents.

Here, we are only configuring <em/Diald/ supposing that the computer
already uses IP-Masquerading, has a web proxy like <em/Squid/ or similar
working, an ISP connection correctly configured and that access security
to TCP/UDP ports have been revised (<tt>/etc/inetd.conf</tt> file and
others like <tt>securetty</tt>, <tt>host.allow</tt>, etc).  

Basically, the only need is to reconfigure the rules for
masquerading/filtering/accessing each time the set of interfaces change,
that is, when the interface ppp0 is stablished and when it is deleted. A
good location to do that are the ip-up and ip-down scripts from <em/pppd/.

<sect1>Example for Debian 2.1
<p>

With Debian, it is sufficient to install the <em/ipmasq/ package answering
that you want to change rules sinchronously with <em/pppd/ when seting it
up. Two scripts will be created inside <tt>/etc/ppp/ip-up.d</tt> and
<tt>/etc/ppp/ip-down.d</tt> directories to call <tt>/sbin/ipmasq</tt>, a
script that analizes existing interfaces and makes a simple configuration
that is valid in many cases, but you can personalize it using rule files
in <tt>/etc/ipmasq/rules</tt>.  

The only correction after installing this package is to change when the
startup script for <em/ipmasq/ is run, deleting the symbolic link from
<tt>/etc/rcS.d</tt> and creating a new one in <tt>/etc/rc2.d</tt> to run
it after <tt/S20diald/. Now, when <tt/ipmasq/ is executed to analyze
interfaces <tt/sl0/ already exist. <tt/S90ipmasq/ is a good name for this
symbolic link to <tt>/etc/init.d/ipmasq</tt>.

Using Debian there is no need to worry about the kernel version, as the
<tt>/sbin/ipmasq</tt> script uses <tt>ipfwadm</tt> or <tt>ipchains</tt> as
needed.

<sect1>Example for Suse 6.1
<p>

This example is from Mr Cornish Rex, <tt><htmlurl
url="mailto:troll@tnet.com.au" name="troll@tnet.com.au"></tt>.

The following ip-masp and routing control commands are for use with
version 2.2 kernels, using ipchains, but they are not valid for version
2.0 kernels.

We are going to supose that the ethernet interface has the 192.168.1.1 ip
address with 16 bit netmask, that is, 255.255.0.0.

This is the <tt>/etc/ppp/ip-up</tt> file:

<sect1>Example for Slackware 3.6
<p>

This example is from Hoo Kok Mun, <tt><htmlurl
url="mailto:hkmun@pacific.net.sg" name="hkmun@pacific.net.sg"></tt>.

This is the most simple example i have seen, but fully functional. From
the beginning, this example configures masquerading, before the <tt/sl0/
interface exists, and it does not change when the <tt/ppp0/ interface
appears. If you need advanced security considerations, it may be a little
limited.

<tscreen><verb>

/sbin/ipfwadm -F -p deny
/sbin/ipfwadm  -F -a m -S 192.168.0.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0

As you can see, it is for version 2.0 kernels.

<sect>Programs and versions used
<p>

To write this document i have used the following diald versions:

<itemize>
<item>Diald 0.16.5 - Last version maintained by the original diald autor.
<item>Diald 0.99.3 - Last version until the first edition of this
document.
</itemize>

And the following pppd versions:

<itemize>
<item>pppd 2.3.5
</itemize>

Diald 0.16.5 version is perhaps the most extended, and the one that many
Linux distributions include. It is suficient for many sites, and it is
very reliable, but, of course, later versions have many interesting
capabilites.
