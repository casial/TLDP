This `Frequently Asked Questions' (FAQ) / HOWTO document describes how to 
configure your Linux machine to use Hebrew characters on X-Windows and Virtual 
Consoles. The most up-to-date version of the Hebrew-HOWTO may be obtained from
<url url="http://shekel.jct.ac.il/~rajwan/Hebrew.html" 
name="my Web page"> or from <url url="ftp://hobbes.jct.ac.il"

<toc>

<sect>Introduction

<p>Any language setup, other than the original American English, has two 
issues:
<enum>
<item> Displaying the right characters (fonts) - for Hebrew it's 
<tt>ISO-8859-8</tt> standard.
<item> Mapping the keyboard. 
</enum>

There is much more to Hebrew than that (like right to left, geometry in 
X-Windows,etc), but this HOWTO (at least for the first draft) deals only 
with the basic issues.

<label id="ISO">More information can be found in the various "national" HOWTOs 
(German, Danish, etc.) and in the ISO 8859-1 HOWTO (<tt><url 
url="ftp://ftp.vlsivie.tuwien.ac.at/pub/8bit" 
name="ftp://ftp.vlsivie.tuwien.ac.at/pub/8bit"> </tt> FAQ-ISO-8859-1).

<sect1>Changes.

<p><itemize>
<item>FIRST DRAFT to 0.2.
<p>Most of this file is taken from the first draft by Vlad Moseanu.
<item>0.2 to 0.3Beta.
<p>Added excerpts from documents from the archive e-brew.zip from <url 
url="ftp://ftp.jer1.co.il/pub/software/msdos/communication" 
name="ftp://ftp.jer1.co.il/pub/software/msdos/communication">, 
and some bug fixes with the help of JCT Linux-il group members.
<item>0.3Beta to 0.4.
<p>After the first release of the Hebrew-HOWTO to the Linux-il it contain all 
the E-mail send to me regarding spelling/grammer and Tex-Xet, Mule and Vim 
info.
</itemize>

<sect1>Thanks

<p>This <tt/HOWTO/ prepared by the help of all the group: Linux-il - 'The Israeli Linux users group' and especially by:

<sect>Standards for representation of Hebrew characters

<sect1>ASCII
<P>To make one thing clear, for once and forever: There is no such thing as
8-bit ASCII. ASCII is only 7 bits. Any 8-bit code is not ASCII, but that
doesn't mean it's not standard. ISO-8859-8 is standard, but not ASCII. Thanks!

<sect1>DOS Hebrew

<p>The Hebrew encoding starts at 128d for Aleph. Therefore, encoding requires 
8 bits. This is what you have on the Video card EPROM hardware fonts, all of 
the Hebrew DOS based editors use this table (Qtext, HED, etc.).

<sect1>ISO Hebrew

<p>The Hebrew encoding starts at 224 for Aleph. This is the Internet standard,
international standard and basically the standard for Ms-Windows and for 
Macintoshes (Dagesh, etc...).

<sect1>OLD PC Hebrew

<p>This is 7-bit, and obsolete, as it occupies essentially the same ASCII 
range as English lowercase letters. So, it is best avoided. However, when 
ISO Hebrew gets its eighth bit stripped off by some ignorant Unix mail program
(so you get a jumble of English letters for the Hebrew part of your message 
and the regular English, reversed or not, mixed in), you will get this, and 
will need to transform it to PC or ISO. If there was English mixed in with 
the Hebrew, this will be a sad situation, as you will either get Hebrew plus 
jumble, or English plus jumble...

<sect1>Conversions

<p>Here are some simple scripts to convert from each standard to the other:
<tscreen><verb>
DOS - ISO:	tr '\200-\232' '\340-\372' < {dos_file} > {iso_file}
ISO - DOS:	tr '\340-\372' '\200-\232' < {iso_file} > {dos_file}
OLD - DOS:	tr -z '\200-\232' < {old_Hebrew_file} > {dos_file}
</verb></tscreen>

NOTE: 	The numbers use by <tt>tr</tt> are in octal!

<sect>Virtual Consoles (VCs)

<p>Every distribution of Slackware comes with kbd; the package is called 
keytbls under Slackware (a4 in 2.3.0 - kbd 0.90). Joel Hoffman has contributed
Hebrew fonts and keymaps from his original codepage.tar.Z file. Look under 
/usr/lib/kbd for iso08.* files. It follows ISO 8859-8 and the Hebrew keytables
and maps.
<p>Put the following lines in /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
<tscreen><verb>
-----
#!/bin/sh
# 	Put any local setup commands in here
#
INITTY=/dev/tty[1-6]
PATH=/sbin:/etc:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
#
# 	kbd - Set the the console font and keyboard
# 	set numlock and set metabit mode on tty1 .. tty8
for tty in $INITTY
do
#	setleds -D +num < $tty > /dev/null
	setmetamode metabit < $tty > /dev/null
done
# 	Latin8(Hebrew) keyboard/console
setfont iso08.f16
mapscrn trivial
loadkeys Hebrew
# 	enable mapping
for tty in $INITTY
do
	echo -n -e "\\033(K" >$tty
done
-----
</verb></tscreen>

NOTE: If you are using X Windows be careful with "setleds", it may hang the X 
server.
<p>The above setup works fine with the Hebrew version of pico (pine) and 
displays correctly ISO 8859-8 Hebrew (X Windows, MS Windows).

<sect>X Windows setup - XFree86 3.1

<sect1>Hebrew fonts.

<p>XFree86 3.1 comes with two Hebrew fonts: heb6x13, heb8x13. Additional 
Hebrew fonts can be found on the Net:
<itemize>
<item><label id="heb-fonts">The web Type1 fonts (Helvetica/David style 
(proportional) and Courier/Shalom Stick style (fixed space) ) from the 
snunit-project archive at <url url="ftp://snunit.huji.ac.il/pub/fonts/" 
name="ftp://snunit.huji.ac.il/pub/fonts/">, it's good for netscape Hebrew 
pages.
<item>Avner Lottem, (<htmlurl url="mailto:lottem@techUnix.technion.ac.il" 
name="lottem@techUnix.technion.ac.il">) put some Hebrew-ISO 8859-8 fonts 
on archive at 
<url url="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/fonts/" 
name="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/fonts/hebxfonts-0.1.tgz">, 
it has a font that's good for dosemu under X-Windows (read his README file).
</itemize>

<sect1>Installing fonts<label id="install-fonts">

<p><itemize>
<item><label id="X11-Fonts">Fonts exaptable: pcf (Portable Compiled Format), 
bdf (Bitmap Distribution Format), pfb (Type1 fonts).

<item>Move the fonts to some existing directory (/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc) or 
create a new one (/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Hebrew). <tt/compress/ (to *.Z) the fonts 
to save space (NOT GZIP!!!).

<item>Run the <tt/mkfontdir/ to create/re-create the <tt/fonts.dir/ and edit 
<tt/fonts.alias/ (optional) to define new aliases. 

<item>For Type1 fonts, <tt>mkfontdir</tt> does nothing. You have to add these 
fonts to <tt>fonts.dir</tt> manually.

<item>Make sure that the directory is in the X server path. Edit the 
XF86Config and add the appropriate path -- FontPath 
"/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/...". 
</itemize>

<sect1>Making an X application to use Hebrew fonts.

<p>In short you need to set the appropriate resource.

<sect2>Xterm
<p>Put the following line in the &dollar;HOME/.Xresources:

<tt>xterm*font:	heb8x13</tt><label id="xterm-font">

or simply start xterm with <tt/xterm -fn heb8x13/
The above font is way too small, so search for a better one ...
See the comments/examples on starting X11.
<sect2>Netscape
<p>Usaly you can use the hebrew fonts from <ref id="heb-fonts" 
name="snunit - webfonts">, Install it <ref id="install-fonts" 
name="as described">, and then put the next defaults in your local 
<tt/.Xdefaults/ or in the app-defaults/Netscape.

In general you can put any fonts insted of the webfonts files as long as
its supported by X11 <ref id="X11-Fonts" name="as described">.
<sect1>Mapping the keyboard.

<p>For some reason the X server doesn't inherit the keymap from the previous 
paragraph, and anyway I would like to define ALT Left and ALT Right and Scroll
Lock. When pressing ALT together with some key it will generate a Hebrew 
character, Scroll Lock will lock in Hebrew mode.

To do that we need to use <tt/xmodmap/. Following is a Xmodmap which also 
corrects the bugs with the "Num Lock":

Actually because the binary version of tcsh is complied without nls the LANG

The lang. name also shows my Digital bias ...

<sect>Applications

<sect1>Vim

<p><itemize>
<item>The Vim is a Vi IMproved editor with some enhanced commands and the
hebrew support was made bu Dov Grobgeld (HED developer).
<item>Another Vim patch announced by Avner Lottem, <htmlurl 
url="mailto:lottem@techunix.technion.ac.il" 
name="lottem@techunix.technion.ac.il"> and can be obtained from <url

</itemize>
<sect1>Hebrew pine and pico
<p><label id="horizon">The pine and it's additional editor pico had been changed by Helen Zommer 
from CC-huji and has a bug-report mail: <htmlurl 
url="mailto:pineh-bug@horizon.cc.huji.ac.il" 
name="pineh-bug@horizon.cc.huji.ac.il">. It can be down-loaded from <url 
url="ftp://horizon.cc.huji.ac.il/pub" name="ftp://horizon.cc.huji.ac.il/pub">.

<sect1>Some emacs Hebrew ports.

<p><itemize>
<item>Hebrew package by Joseph Friedman. It includes some Hebrew fonts in BDF 
format, patch for emacs 18.58 and an elisp package. It is fine, but nobody 
uses emacs 18.* anymore. It can be obtained from: 
<url 
url="ftp://archive.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/misc/Hebrew.tar.Z" 
name="ftp://archive.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/misc/Hebrew.tar.Z">.
<item>A very simple Hebrew package. Includes only right-to-left cursor movement
support and right-to-left sorting. Works without any patches with FSF emacs 
19. Can be obtained from 
<url url="ftp://archive.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/misc/Hebrew.el.Z" 
name="ftp://archive.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/misc/Hebrew.el.Z">.
<item>One of emacs branches - MULE (Multi Lingual Emacs) Supports a lot of 
languages including Hebrew. It compiles and runs under Linux with no problem. 
It is full Emacs, with Hebrew support and double-direction handling. It can be 
obtained from: <url url="ftp://kelim.jct.ac.il/pub/Hebrew" 
name="ftp://kelim.jct.ac.il/pub/Hebrew">
</itemize>

<sect1>Dosemu

<p>For a VC dosemu you can use your Hebrew from the Video card EPROM, and if 
you don't have it there are plenty of Hebrew dos fonts from EGA support to 
the VGA Hebrew support.
<p>For X-Windows support you should download the file:
<url url="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/fonts/hebxfonts-0.1.tgz" 
name="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/fonts/hebxfonts-0.1.tgz">
it's contain some fonts include one called vgah.pcf that you should install 
it on your fonts directory as describe <ref id="install-fonts" name="above">
the fonts are:

<sect1>XHTerm

<p>There is a main port of the regular X-Term program for use with a Hebrew 
fonts - XHTerm =  xterm +  Hebrew support. The port for a sun machine was 
made avalible by the help of Danny <htmlurl url="mailto:danny@cs.huji.ac.il" 
name="<tt>danny@cs.huji.ac.il</tt>">. Evgeny has some patch for use this port 
under Linux. His version should come with a pre-compiled XHTerm for both 
X11R5 and X11R6. You should use xhterm with the option <tt/-fn/ and a Hebrew 
font <ref id="xterm-font" name="as described">!
Danny's port (for SUN) can be obtained from: 
<url url="ftp://ftp.huji.ac.il/pub/local/xhterm" 
name="ftp://ftp.huji.ac.il/pub/local/xhterm">
and the patched version of Evgeny Stambulchik is on: 
<url url="ftp://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/pub/software/linux" 
name="ftp://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/pub/software/linux">
Get it from there and you'll get 5 <ref id="install-fonts" name="fonts with 
it">: <tt>[heb10x20.pcf, heb6x13.bdf, heb6x13.pcf, heb8x13.bdf, heb8x13.pcf]</tt>

<sect1>TeX--XeT - Hebrew Tex.

<p>The bigest problem with Tex with Hebrew is that the charecters should go 
backwards relative to Visual look (i.e. pico inserts the charecters from 
right to left), so the best thing is to get XHterm with a regular emacs and 
write the Hebrew left to right, backwards as well. 
<p>The newer NTeX distribution on sunsite (v1.5) includes everything, including
TeX--XeT, precompiled for Linux. It can be obtained from 
<url url="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu.gz/pub/Linux/apps/tex/ntex" 
name="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu.gz/pub/Linux/apps/tex/ntex">. An older version of 
TeX--XeT can be obtained from 
<url url="ftp://noa.huji.ac.il/tex" name="ftp://noa.huji.ac.il/tex">. This
older version, however, has to be recompiled (not recommended).
<p>These TeX distributions are fine if you use LaTeX2.09. If you want to use
LaTeX2e (the current de facto standard) you have a problem.
Alon Ziv <htmlurl url="mailto:alonz@csa.cs.technion.ac.il" 
name="(alonz@csa.cs.technion.ac.il)"> is currently working in support for
LaTeX2e with Hebrew, using the Babel languages system. I don't know the
current status of his work -- ask him!

<sect>Printer setup

<p>Mainly there is not to say, if you have a regular ASCII line printer
(who does, these days?) there is a good chance that there are Hebrew fonts
in it on the <tt>EPROM</tt> chip.
<p>If you use PostScript, you should download soft fonts to the printer (you
can always use the <ref id="heb-fonts" name="earlier mentioned"> Web fonts for
that. These fonts are also useable with Ghostscript).
<p>If you have a PCL printer (LaserJet etc.), you can either use font 
cartridges or use Ghostscript.

<sect>Commercial products.

<sect1>El-Mar software.
<p>The Hebrew Support for X-Windows &amp; Motif, is a product of El-Mar
Software, which adds Hebrew functionality to many of the parts and layers of
X-Windows and Motif, including Xlib, all of the widgets of Motif, hterm
(Hebrew xterm), demos and simple useful applications (e.g. bi-lingual
Motif-based editor), fonts (including scalable Type1), keyboard-manager in
order to allow Hebrew and push-mode for non-Motif applications, etc. 
<p>Despite allowing many new features and variations for Motif widgets, the 
support doesn't have any modification to internal data-structures of Motif, so
existing applications which were compiled and linked under non-Hebrew
environment and libraries, can be relinked (without compilation!) and run
with Hebrew (you can replace shared-libraries, so even the relink is not
needed!) 
<p>By using another tool of us, Motif/Xplorer, you can take commercial
applications (without their source) and translate them to Hebrew. This was
the way of giving Hebrew support for Oracle Forms 4, Intellicorp's Kappa and
OMW, CA-Unicenter, and many other leading UNIX tools sold in Israel. This
