<sect>About this HOWTO
<p>

<sect1>Introduction<label id="intro">
<p>

<url url="http://www.Psion.com/" name="Psion"> has been making PDA's for years. This document will concentrate on the Series 5* models, e.g. Series 5, <url url="http://www.series5mx.com/" name="Series 5mx"> and Series 5mx PRO and the 32 bit EPOC operating system they come with, but there will be some crossover to older models such as the Series 3* and newer models such as the Series 7. There is also a little information about other <ref id="series3" name="series"> at the end of this document.

<sect1>Mailing List<label id="maillist">
<p>

There is a mailing list dedicated to using Psions with Linux and developing tools to enhance communication between them.

To subscribe, send a message to <htmlurl url="mailto:plptools-developers-request@lists.SourceForge.net" name="plptools-developers-request@lists.SourceForge.net">. John Schrader has put up a <url url="http://rz-home.de/~jschrade/linux-psion.html" name="searchable list"> of messages from Oct 1998 through Feb 1999.

There is also a mailing list dedicated to porting Linux to the Psion 5* models at <htmlurl url="mailto:linux-7110-request@lists.SourceForge.net" name="linux-7110-request@lists.SourceForge.net">. An archive beginning 04Dec1999 is available at <url url="http://web.gnu.walfield.org/mail-archive/linux-7110/">.

Both mailing lists can be searched through the SourceForge interface.

<sect>General Information<label id="geninfo">
<p>

<sect1>What is a Psion<label id="whatispsion">
<p>

Psion is a powerful Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) with pen-based touch screen as well as keyboard. There are several models. This HOWTO currently only covers the Series 5* models, e.g. Series 5, Series 5mx and Series 5mxPro.


<sect1>Psion models<label id="models">
<p>

There are several models of Psion PDAs. All have a foldout case where the screen is in the cover and opening the Psion causes the keyboard to jut out to a more usable position. They also feature the instant on and instant off capabilities of the EPOC operating system.

Psion 3* are older PDAs that still have a lot of functionality and still get sold new due to their meeting needs and being lower cost. This HOWTO doesn't currently cover the Psion 3* series.

Psion 5* has two main product lines with each having two models. The Psion series 5 has a green limited edition counterpart with no functional difference between itself and the standard Series 5. The series 5mxPro, however, has some fundamental differences from the Series 5mx.

All four of the Series 5* products have: compact flash, serial port, keyboard and stylus (for the touchscreen). They all operate on 2 AA batteries and have a backup battery to maintain state when changing out the main batteries. Check out <url url="http://psion.by.ru/psioninside/s5inside/index.htm" name="Akaev's site"> to take a tour of a dissected Series 5 classic.

Both of the Series 5 models as well as the Series 5mx have system ROMs where the EPOC operating system is stored. After boot they operate out of the RAM (8MB for the Series 5 models and 16MB for the Series 5mx). The Series 5mxPro, however, has no ROM and operates entirely out of its 24MB of RAM. This enables software upgrades to the Series 5mxPro, whereas the other 3 models must exchange hardware to update EPOC.

Psion has also released the Series 7, which is set to compete against the subnotebook class of PC, but running EPOC. They also have a Revo, which is smaller than the Series 5*.

<sect1>Psion Availability<label id="availability">
<p>

Psion products are no longer available at retail stores in the US. They are available from retail shops in Europe as well as through mail order. Psion maintains a list of <url url="http://www.psion.com/resellers/index.html" name="mail order"> firms by country on their web site.

<sect>Sharing data between the Psion and Linux<label id="datasharing">
<p>

<sect1>Hardware connectivity options<label id="hwconn">
<p>

The Psions have both serial and infra red ports. Either can be used for connectivity, but most connectivity programs currently only have features for the serial port connection.

<sect2>Serial cable<label id="serial">
<p>

Armin Podtschaske x-rayed the "honda" connector.

<!--His <url url="http://home.t-online.de/home/armin.podtschaske/pocci.htm" name="page"> has an explanation of the pin out in German.

Here it is for those who don't speak German :).
-->

Pin 1 is on the top and pin 15 is on the bottom. Only pins 2 through 8 and 15 are connected.

<itemize>
<item>Pin 2: RTS 
<item>Pin 3: DTR 
<item>Pin 4: TXD 
<item>Pin 5: DSR 
<item>Pin 6: DCD 
<item>Pin 7: CTS 
<item>Pin 8: RXD 
<item>Pin 15: GND - Signal and Power ground 
<item>Frame: GND - Shield frame ground 
</itemize>

<sect2>IrDA<label id="irda">
<p>

See Werner Heuser's <url url="http://www.LinuxDoc.org/HOWTO/Infrared-HOWTO/" name="Infrared HOWTO"> for information about using the Linux IrDA driver with a Psion. It is possible to beam files from Psion 5 (mx) via Linux-IrDA to a Linux System. The irda-utils include a special client psion5.c which can beam files
between them.

<sect2>Builtin programs<label id="builtin">
<p>

There are two builtin software methods to use the communications ports. The first is the <em>remote link</em>, <tt>&lt;ctrl>-l</tt> from the main file menu, which can be set to serial, infrared or off.

EPOC also provides the program <tt>comms</tt>. The remote link must be set to off for the <tt>comms</tt> program to have access to the serial port.

<sect1>Programs for connectivity<label id="swconn">

<sect2>plptools<label id="plptools">
<p>

<descrip>
<tag>Description</tag>

<url url="http://SourceForge.net/projects/plptools" name="plptools"> was originally developed by Fritz Elfert, who had merged plp and <ref id="pxnfs" name="p3nfs/p5nfs">. plptools is currently being worked on by members of the PLP Tools project.

plptools comprises of 3 different programs. ncpd provides a socket connection to the Psion. plpnfsd provides mounted filesystem access to the Psion and plpftp provides ftp access to the Psion.

<!--
See <url url="ftp://ftp.to.com/pub/psion/"> for Fritz' original releases.
-->

<tag>Usage</tag>

ncpd &lsqb;-V&rsqb; &lsqb;-v logclass&rsqb; &lsqb;-d&rsqb; &lsqb;-p &lt;port>&rsqb; &lsqb;-s &lt;device>&rsqb; &lsqb;-b &lt;baudrate>&rsqb;

plpnfsd &lsqb;-v&rsqb; &lsqb;-V&rsqb; &lsqb;-p port&rsqb; &lsqb;-d mountdir&rsqb; &lsqb;-u user&rsqb;

First start ncpd get it to listen on a port (7501 by default) for connection requests. Then, start either plpnfsd or plpftp. plpnfsd defaults to mount the Psion under /mnt/psion.

<tag>Description</tag>

<url url="ftp://ftp.cs.unm.edu/mirrors/kde/unstable/apps/utils/kpsion-0.1.tar.gz" name="kpsion"> is available under <url url="ftp://ftp.cs.unm.edu/mirrors/kde/unstable/apps/utils/" name="unstable/apps/utils/"> at your favorite KDE mirror.

It provides a method to use kfm (KDE File Manager) to directly access files on the Psion via a serial link. Psion files can be opened by using 'psion:' or 'epoc:' URLs. It uses ncpd from the plptools package, which must be running to use kpsion, to handle the serial connection.

kpsion also has a Psion Word->HTML/Text viewer/ converter built from psiconv to allow viewing documentation created with Psion Word under Linux.

kpsion is currently ALPHA support for connecting to a Psion Series 5*. It is only available in source and only builds against KDE 1.1 and KDE 1.2. Please read the README and INSTALL files that come with the tarball.
