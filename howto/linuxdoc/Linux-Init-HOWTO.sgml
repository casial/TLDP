<chapt>Introduction<p>

Portions of this text come from comments in the kernel source
files (obviously).  I have added annotations in many places.
I hope that this will be useful to kernel developers -- either
new ones or experienced ones who need more of this type of
information.  However, if there's not enough detail here for
you, "Use the Source."

<sect>Overview<p>

This description is organized as a brief overview which
lists the sections that are described later in more detail.

The description is in three main sections.  The first section covers
early kernel initialization on IA-32 (but only after your boot loader of
choice and other intermediate loaders have run; i.e., this description
does not cover loading the kernel).
This section is based on the code in "linux/arch/i386/boot/setup.S"
and "linux/arch/i386/boot/video.S".

The second major section covers Linux initialization that is
x86- (or i386- or IA-32-) specific.  This section is based on the source
files "linux/arch/i386/kernel/head.S" and "linux/arch/i386/kernel/setup.c".

The third major section covers Linux initialization that is
architecture-independent.  This section is based on the flow in the
source file "linux/init/main.c".

See the References section for other valuable documents
about booting, loading, and initialization.

<sect>This document<p>

This document describes Linux 2.4.x initialization on IA-32
(or i386 or x86) processors -- after one or more kernel boot loaders
(if any) have done their job.

You can format it using the commands (for example):

<tscreen><verb>
% sgml2txt ia32_init_240.sgml
</verb></tscreen>
or
<tscreen><verb>
% sgml2html ia32_init_240.sgml
</verb></tscreen>

This will produce plain ASCII or HTML files respectively.
You can also produce LaTeX, GNU, and RTF info by using the proper
sgmltool (man sgmltools).

<chapt>Linux init ("ASCII art")<p>

Pictorially (loosely speaking :), Linux initialization looks like
this, where "[...]" means optional (depends on the kernel's
configuration) and "{...}" is a comment.

<chapt>Linux early setup<p>

(from linux/arch/i386/boot/setup.S and linux/arch/i386/boot/video.S)

NOTE:  Register notation is %regname and constant notation is a number,
with or without a leading '$' sign.

<sect> IA-32 Kernel Setup <p>

"setup.S" is responsible for getting the system data from the BIOS
and putting them into the appropriate places in system memory.

Both "setup.S" and the kernel have been loaded by the boot block.

"setup.S" is assembled as 16-bit real-mode code.
It switches the processor to 32-bit protected mode and jumps to
the 32-bit kernel code.

This code asks the BIOS for memory/disk/other parameters, and
puts them in a "safe" place: 0x90000-0x901FF, that is, where the
boot block used to be.  It is then up to the protected mode
system to read them from there before the area is overwritten
for buffer-blocks.

The "setup.S" code begins with a jmp instruction around the
"setup header", which must begin at location %cs:2.

This is the setup header:

<tscreen><code>
		.ascii	"HdrS"		# header signature
		.word	0x0202		# header version number
realmode_swtch:	.word	0, 0		# default_switch, SETUPSEG
start_sys_seg:	.word	SYSSEG
		.word	kernel_version	# pointer to kernel version string
type_of_loader:	.byte	0
loadflags:
LOADED_HIGH	= 1		# If set, the kernel is loaded high
#ifndef __BIG_KERNEL__
		.byte	0
#else
		.byte	LOADED_HIGH
#endif
setup_move_size: .word  0x8000	# size to move, when setup is not
				# loaded at 0x90000.
code32_start:			# here loaders can put a different
				# start address for 32-bit code.
#ifndef __BIG_KERNEL__
		.long	0x1000	# default for zImage
#else
		.long	0x100000# default for big kernel
#endif
ramdisk_image:	.long	0	# address of loaded ramdisk image
ramdisk_size:	.long	0	# its size in bytes

					# for local heap purposes.

				# If nonzero, a 32-bit pointer

		.space	1024
# End of setup header #####################################################
</code></tscreen>

<sect1> start_of_setup: <p>

<sect2> Read second hard drive DASD type <p>

Read the DASD type of the second hard drive (BIOS int. 0x13,
%ax=0x1500, %dl=0x81).

# Bootlin depends on this being done early. [TBD:why?]

<sect2> Check that LILO loaded us right <p>

Check the signature words at the end of setup.
Signature words are used to ensure that LILO loaded us right.
If the two words are not found correctly, copy the
setup sectors and check for the signature words again.
If they still aren't found, panic("No setup signature found ...").

<sect2> Check old loader trying to load a big kernel <p>

If the kernel image is "big" (and hence is "loaded high"), then
if the loader cannot handle "loaded high" images, then
panic ("Wrong loader, giving up...").


<sect2> Determine system memory size <p>

Get the extended memory size {above 1 MB} in KB.
First clear the extended memory size to 0.

#ifndef STANDARD_MEMORY_BIOS_CALL

Clear the E820 memory area counter.

Try three different memory detection schemes. <newline>
First, try E820h, which lets us assemble a memory map, then try E801h,
which returns a 32-bit memory size, and finally 88h, which
returns 0-64 MB.

Method E820H populates a table in the empty_zero_block that contains
a list of usable address/size/type tuples.
In "linux/arch/i386/kernel/setup.c", this information is
transferred into the e820map, and in "linux/arch/i386/mm/init.c", that
new information is used to mark pages reserved or not.

Method E820H: <newline>
Get the BIOS memory map.  E820h returns memory classified into
different types and allows memory holes.
We scan through this memory map and build a list of the first
32 memory areas {up to 32 entries or BIOS says that there are no
more entries}, which we return at "E820MAP".
[See URL: http://www.teleport.com/~acpi/acpihtml/topic245.htm]

Method E801H: <newline>
We store the 0xe801 memory size in a completely different place,
because it will most likely be longer than 16 bits.

This is the sum of 2 registers, normalized to 1 KB chunk sizes:
%ecx = memory size from 1 MB to 16 MB range, in 1 KB chunks +
%edx = memory size above 16 MB, in 64 KB chunks.

Ye Olde Traditional Methode: <newline>
BIOS int. 0x15/AH=0x88 returns the memory size (up to 16 MB or 64 MB,
depending on the BIOS).
We always use this method, regardless of the results of the other
two methods.

#endif

Set the keyboard repeat rate to the maximum rate using
using BIOS int. 0x16.

<sect2> Video adapter modes <p>

Find the video adapter and its supported modes and allow the
user to browse video modes.

	call	video		# {see Video section below}

<sect2> Get Hard Disk parameters <p>

Get hd0 data:
Save the hd0 descriptor (from int. vector 0x41) at INITSEG:0x80 length 0x10.

Get hd1 data:
Save the hd1 descriptor (from int. vector 0x46) at INITSEG:0x90 length 0x10.

Check that there IS an hd1, using BIOS int. 0x13.
If not, clear its descriptor.

<sect2> Get Micro Channel bus information <p>

Check for Micro Channel (MCA) bus:
<itemize>
<item> Set MCA feature table length to 0 in case not found.
<item> Get System Configuration Parameters (BIOS int. 0x15/%ah=0xc0).
  This sets %es:%bx to point to the system feature table.
<item> We keep only the first 16 bytes of the system feature table if found:
  Structure size, Model byte, Submodel byte, BIOS revision,
  and Feature information bytes 1-5.
  Bit 0 or 1 (either one) of Feature byte 1 indicates that the system
  contains a Micro Channel bus.
</itemize>

<sect2> Check for mouse <p>

Check for PS/2 pointing device by using BIOS int. 0x11 {get equipment list}.
<itemize>
<item> Clear the pointing device flag (default).
<item> BIOS int. 0x11: get equipment list.
<item> If bit 2 (value 0x04) is set, then a mouse is installed and the
  pointing device flag is set to indicate that the device is present.
</itemize>

<sect2> Check for APM BIOS support <p>

Check for an APM BIOS (if kernel is configured for APM support):
<itemize>
<item> start: clear version field to 0, which means no APM BIOS present.
<item> Check for APM BIOS installation using BIOS int. 0x15.
<item> If not present, done.
<item> Check for "PM" signature returned in %bx.
<item> If no signature, then no APM BIOS: done.
<item> Check for 32-bit support in %cx.
<item> If no 32-bit support, no (good) APM BIOS: done.
  Must have 32-bit APM BIOS support to be used by Linux.
<item> Save the BIOS code segment, BIOS entry point offset,
  BIOS 16-bit code segment, BIOS data segment,
 BIOS code segment length, and BIOS data segment length.
<item> Record the APM BIOS version and flags.
</itemize>

<sect2> Prepare to move to protected mode <p>

We build a jump instruction to the kernel's code32_start address.
(The loader may have changed it.)

Move the kernel to its correct place if necessary.

Load the segment descriptors (load %ds = %cs).

Make sure that we are at the right position in memory, to
accommodate the command line and boot parameters at their
fixed locations.

Load the IDT pointer register with 0,0.

Calculate the linear base address of the kernel GDT (table) and load the
GDT pointer register with its base address and limit.
This early kernel GDT describes kernel code as 4 GB, with base address 0,
code/readable/executable, with granularity of 4 KB.
The kernel data segment is described as 4 GB, with base address 0,
data/readable/writable, with granularity of 4 KB.

<sect2> Enable address line A20 <p>

<itemize>
<item> Empty the 8042 (keyboard controller) of any queued keys.
<item> Write 0xd1 (Write Output Port) to Command Register port 0x64.
<item> Empty the 8042 (keyboard controller) of any queued keys.
<item> Write 0xdf (Gate A20 + more) to Output port 0x60.
<item> Empty the 8042 (keyboard controller) of any queued keys.
<item> Set bit number 1 (value 0x02: FAST_A20) in the "port 0x92"
  system control register.  This enables A20 on some systems, depending
  on the chipset used in them.
<item> Wait until A20 really *is* enabled; it can take a fair amount of
  time on certain systems.
  The memory location used here (0x200) is the int 0x80
  vector, which should be safe to use.
  When A20 is disabled, the test memory locations are an alias
  of each other (segment 0:offset 0x200 and segment 0xffff:offset 0x210).
  {0xffff0 + 0x210 = 0x100200, but if A20 is disabled, this becomes
  0x000200.}
  We just wait (busy wait/loop) until these memory locations are
  no longer aliased.
</itemize>

<sect2> Make sure any possible coprocessor is properly reset <p>

<itemize>
<item> Write 0 to port 0xf0 to clear the Math Coprocessor '-busy' signal.
<item> Write 0 to port 0xf1 to reset the Math Coprocessor.
</itemize>

<sect2> Mask all interrupts <p>

Now we mask all interrupts; the rest is done in init_IRQ().

<itemize>
<item> Mask off all interrupts on the slave PIC: write 0xff to port 0xa1.
<item> Mask off all interrupts on the master PIC except for IRQ2,
  which is the cascaded IRQ input from the slave PIC: write 0xfb to port 0x21.
</itemize>

<sect2> Move to Protected Mode <p>

Now is the time to actually move into protected mode.  To make
things as simple as possible, we do no register setup or anything,
we let the GNU-compiled 32-bit programs do that.  We just jump to
absolute address 0x1000 (or the loader supplied one),
in 32-bit protected mode.

Note that the short jump isn't strictly needed, although there are
reasons why it might be a good idea.  It won't hurt in any case.

Set the PE (Protected mode Enable) bit in the MSW and jump to the
following instruction to flush the instruction fetch queue.

Clear %bx to indicate that this is the BSP (first CPU only).

<sect2> Jump to startup_32 code <p>

Jump to the 32-bit kernel code (startup_32).

NOTE:  For high-loaded big kernels we need: <newline>
<tscreen><verb>
	jmpi    0x100000,__KERNEL_CS
</verb></tscreen>
but we yet haven't reloaded the %cs register, so the default size 
of the target offset still is 16 bit.
However, using an operand prefix (0x66), the CPU will properly
take our 48-bit far pointer. (INTeL 80386 Programmer's Reference
Manual, Mixing 16-bit and 32-bit code, page 16-6).

<tscreen><verb>
	.byte 0x66, 0xea		# prefix + jmpi-opcode
code32:	.long	0x1000			# or 0x100000 for big kernels
	.word	__KERNEL_CS
</verb></tscreen>

This jumps to "startup_32" in "linux/arch/i386/kernel/head.S".

<sect> Video Setup <p>

"linux/arch/i386/boot/video.S" is included into
"linux/arch/i386/boot/setup.S", so they are assembled together.
The file separation is a logical module separation even though
the two modules aren't built separately.

"video.S" handles Linux/i386 display adapter and video mode setup.
For more information about Linux/i386 video modes, see
"linux/Documentation/svga.txt" by Martin Mares [mj@ucw.cz].

Video mode selection is a kernel build option.  When it is
enabled, You can select a specific (fixed) video mode to be used
during kernel booting or you can ask to view a selection menu
and then choose a video mode from that menu.

There are a few esoteric (!) "video.S" build options that
not covered here.  See "linux/Documentation/svga.txt" for all
of them.

CONFIG_VIDEO_SVGA (for automatic detection of SVGA adapters and
modes) is normally #undefined.  The normal method of video
adapter detection on Linux/i386 is VESA (CONFIG_VIDEO_VESA,
for autodetection of VESA modes).

"video:" is the main entry point called by "setup.S".
The %ds register *must* be pointing to the bootsector.
The "video.S" code uses different segments from the main "setup.S" code.

This is a simplified description of the code flow in "video.S".
It does not address the CONFIG_VIDEO_LOCAL, CONFIG_VIDEO_400_HACK,
and CONFIG_VIDEO_GFX_HACK build options and it does not dive deep
into video BIOS calls or video register accesses.

<sect1> video: <p>

<chapt>Linux architecture-specific initialization<p>

(from "linux/arch/i386/kernel/head.S")

The boot code in "linux/arch/i386/boot/setup.S" transfers execution
to the beginning code in "linux/arch/i386/kernel/head.S"
(labeled "startup_32:").

To get to this point, a small uncompressed kernel function
decompresses the remaining compressed kernel image
and then it jumps to the new kernel code.

This is a description of what the "head.S" code does.

<sect>startup_32:<p>

swapper_pg_dir is the top-level page directory, address 0x00101000.

On entry, %esi points to the real-mode code as a 32-bit pointer.

<sect>Set segment registers to known values<p>

Set the %ds, %es, %fs, and %gs registers to __KERNEL_DS.

<sect>SMP BSP (Bootstrap Processor) check<p>

#ifdef CONFIG_SMP

If %bx is zero, this is a boot on the Bootstrap Processor (BSP),
so skip this.  Otherwise, for an AP (Application Processor):

If the desired %cr4 setting is non-zero, turn on the paging options
(PSE, PAE, ...) and skip "Initialize page tables" (jump to "Enable paging").

#endif /* CONFIG_SMP */

<sect>Initialize page tables<p>

Begin at pg0 (page 0) and init all pages to 007 (PRESENT + RW + USER).

<sect>Enable paging<p>

Set %cr3 (page table pointer) to swapper_pg_dir.

Set the paging ("PG") bit of %cr0 to <newline>
<bf>********** enable paging **********</bf>.

Jump $ to flush the prefetch queue.

Jump *[$] to make sure that %eip is relocated.

Setup the stack pointer (lss stack_start, %esp).

#ifdef CONFIG_SMP

If this is not the BSP (Bootstrap Processor), clear all flags bits
and jump to checkCPUtype.

#endif /* CONFIG_SMP */

<sect>Clear BSS<p>

The BSP clears all of BSS (area between __bss_start and _end)
for the kernel.

<sect>32-bit setup<p>

Setup the IDT for 32-bit mode (call setup_idt).
setup_idt sets up an IDT with 256 entries pointing to the default
interrupt handler "ignore_int" as interrupt gates.  It doesn't actually
load the IDT; that can be done only after paging has been enabled
and the kernel moved to PAGE_OFFSET.  Interrupts
are enabled elsewhere, when we can be relatively
sure everything is OK.

Clear the eflags register (before switching to protected mode).

<sect>Copy boot parameters and command line out of the way<p>

First 2 KB of _empty_zero_page is for boot parameters,
second 2 KB is for the command line.

<sect>checkCPUtype<p>

Initialize X86_CPUID to -1.

Use Flags register, push/pop results, and CPUID instruction(s) to
determine CPU type and vendor:
  Sets X86, X86_CPUID, X86_MODEL, X86_MASK, and X86_CAPABILITY.
  Sets bits in %cr0 accordingly.

Also checks for presence of an 80287 or 80387 coprocessor.
  Sets X86_HARD_MATH if a math coprocessor or floating point unit is found.

<sect>Count this processor<p>

For CONFIG_SMP builds, increment the "ready" counter to keep a tally
of the number of CPUs that have been initialized.

<sect>Load descriptor table pointer registers<p>

Load GDT with gdt_descr and IDT with idt_descr.
The GDT contains 2 entries for the kernel (4 GB each for code and
data, beginning at 0) and 2 userspace entries (4 GB each for code and
data, beginning at 0).  There are 2 null descriptors between the
userspace descriptors and the APM descriptors.

The GDT also contains 4 entries for APM segments.
The APM segments have byte granularity and their bases and limits
are set at runtime.

The rest of the gdt_table (after the APM segments) is space for
TSSes and LDTs.

Jump to __KERNEL_CS:%eip to cause the GDT to be used.  Now in <newline>
<bf>********** protected mode **********</bf>.

Reload all of the segment registers:
  Set the %ds, %es, %fs, and %gs registers to __KERNEL_DS.

#ifdef CONFIG_SMP

Reload the stack pointer segment only (%ss) with __KERNEL_DS.

#else /* not CONFIG_SMP */

Reload the stack pointer (%ss:%esp) with stack_start.

#endif /* CONFIG_SMP */

Clear the LDT pointer to 0.

Clear the processor's Direction Flag (DF) to 0 for gcc.

<sect>Start other processors<p>

For CONFIG_SMP builds,
if this is not the first (Bootstrap) CPU, call initialize_secondary(),
which does not return.  The secondary (AP) processor(s) are
initialized and then enter idle state until processes are
scheduled on them.

If this is the first or only CPU, call start_kernel(). (see below)

/* the calls above should never return, but in case they do: */

L6:  jmp L6

<chapt>Linux architecture-independent initialization<p>

(from "linux/init/main.c")

"linux/init/main.c" begins execution with the start_kernel() function,
which is called from "linux/arch/i386/kernel/head.S".
start_kernel() never returns to its caller.  It ends by calling the
cpu_idle() function.

<sect>start_kernel:<p>

Interrupts are still disabled.  Do necessary setups, then enable them.

Lock the kernel (BKL: big kernel lock).

Print the linux_banner string (this string resides in "linux/init/version.c")
using printk().  NOTE:  printk() doesn't actually print this to the console
yet; it just buffers the string until a console device registers itself with
the kernel, then the kernel passes the buffered console log contents to the
registered console device(s).  There can be multiple registered console
devices.

********** printk() can be called very early because it doesn't actually
print to anywhere.  It just logs the message to "log_buf",
which is allocated statically in "linux/kernel/printk.c".
The messages that are saved in "log_buf" are passed to registered
console devices as they register. **********

<sect1>More architecture-specific init<p>

Call setup_arch(&amp;command_line):

This performs architecture-specific initializations
(details below).
Then back to architecture-independent initialization....

The remainder of start_kernel() is done as follows for all
processor architecures, although several of these function
calls are to architecture-specific setup/init functions.

<sect1>Continue architecture-independent init<p>
Print the kernel command line.

<sect1>Parsing command line options<p>

parse_options(command_line):
Parse the kernel options on the command line.
This is a simple kernel command line parsing function.  It parses the
command line and fills in the arguments and environment to init (thread)
as appropriate.  Any command-line option is taken to be an environment
variable if it contains the character '='.
It also checks for options meant for the kernel by calling
checksetup(), which checks the command line for kernel parameters,
these being specified by declaring them using "__setup", as in:

<tscreen><code>
__setup("debug", debug_kernel);
</code></tscreen>

This declaration causes the debug_kernel() function to be
called when the string "debug" is scanned.
See "linux/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt" for the list of
kernel parameters.

These options are not given to init -- they are for internal kernel
use only.  The default argument list for the init thread is
{"init", NULL}, with a maximum of 8 command-line arguments.
The default environment list for the init thread is
{"HOME=/", "TERM=linux", NULL}, with a maximum of 8
command-line environment variable settings.
In case LILO is going to boot us with default command line,
it prepends "auto" before the whole cmdline which makes
the shell think it should execute a script with such name.
So we ignore all arguments entered _before_ init=... [MJ]

<sect1> Start other SMP processors (as applicable) <p>

smp_init() works in one of three ways, depending upon the kernel

For a uniprocessor (UP) system without an IO APIC
(CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC is not defined), smp_init() is empty -- it
has nothing to do.

For a UP system with (an) IO APIC for interrupt
routing, it calls IO_APIC_init_uniprocessor().

For an SMP system, its main job is to call the architecture-specific
function "smp_boot_cpus()", which does the following.

<itemize>
<item> For CONFIG_MTRR kernels, calls mtrr_init_boot_cpu(), which must be
  done before the other processors are booted.
<item> Stores and prints the BSP CPU information.
<item> Saves the BSP APIC ID and BSP logical CPU ID (latter is 0).
<item> If an MP BIOS interrupt routing table was not found, revert to

  actually used to 1 (not SMP), then ignore the MP BIOS interrupt
  routing table.
<item> Switch the system from PIC mode to symmetric I/O interrupt mode.
<item> Setup the BSP's local APIC.
<item> Use the CPU present map to boot the APs serially.  Wait for each
  AP to finish booting before starting the next one.
<item> If using (an) IO APIC {which is True unless the "noapic" boot option
  was used}, setup the IO APIC(s).

<sect1>cpu_idle()<p>

This function remains as process number 0.  Its purpose is

nominally executes a "hlt" instruction.

<sect>setup_arch<p>

to find and reserve any boot-time SMP configuration information
memory, such as MP (Multi Processor) table data from the BIOS.

<sect1>paging_init()<p>

paging_init() sets up the page tables - note that the first 8 MB

{end of setup_arch()}

<sect>init thread<p>

The init thread begins at the init() function in
"linux/init/main.c".  This is always expected to be process
number 1.

init() first locks the kernel and then calls do_basic_setup()
to perform lots of bus and/or device initialization
{more detail below}.  After do_basic_setup(), most kernel
initialization has been completed.  init() then frees
any memory that was specified as being for initialization
only [marked with "__init", "__initdata", "__init_call",
or "__initsetup"] and unlocks the kernel (BKL).

init() next opens /dev/console and duplicates that file
descriptor two times to create stdin, stdout,
and stderr files for init and all of its children.

Finally init() tries to execute the command specified
on the kernel parameters command line if there was one,
or an init program or script if it can find one in
{/sbin/init, /etc/init, /bin/init}, and lastly
/bin/sh.  If init() cannot execute any of these,
it panics ("No init found.  Try passing init= option to kernel.")

<sect>do_basic_setup {part of the init thread}<p>

The machine is now initialized.  None of the devices
have been touched yet, but the CPU subsystem is up and
running, and memory and process management works.
