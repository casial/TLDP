<sect>Introduction
<p>
The directions below will produce the RedHat (currently version 6.2 is used,
7.0 is in development) Linux system that boots into the bare (=no window
manager, like gnome, kde or fvwm2) X server and starts Netscape Navigator (not
Communicator, which includes Main and News clients). Upon exiting the browser
the X server is restarted and the new Netscape process is launched as
needed. The system is intended for Internet Kiosks and similar applications.
Security is emphasized at all the stages of the setup.
<p>
This HOWTO will be updated (maybe significantly) as long as more reports about the deployment of
such boxes will arrive.

This document currently contains information for Netscape Navigator
only, but I plan to add notes for other browsers too as I get the
necessary information.  If you try this with a different browser,
please let me know.
</p>


<sect1>Introduction

<p>
The basic idea here is to give web access to people who wander by,
while limiting their ability to mess anything up.
</p>

<p>
This setup was originally intended for trade shows, but it might be
applicable other places you want to have a web browser going without
having to babysit a computer.
</p>

<p>
Following these instructions
does <bf>not</bf> make your system bulletproof or idiot-proof.
</p>


<sect1>Before you begin

<sect2>You need a graphical browser

<p>
This document assumes that you already have a running graphical web browser,
such as Netscape Navigator, on your system.
You should have permission to use your graphical web browser.
If you want to use Netscape Navigator in a commercial setting,
you can buy a copy with appropriate license through Caldera.
</p>


<sect2>You need to be able to add an account

<p>
If you don't have the right to be <bf>root</bf>,
get the system administrator to add the ``<tt>guest</tt>'' account
and give you ownership of <tt>guest</tt>'s home directory.
Skip to the ``Create or edit the following files'' step
(<ref id="CreateEditHomeGuestFiles"
    name="Create or edit the following files in /home/guest">)
when he or she is done.
</p>


<sect2>You need <tt>httpd</tt> for a stand-alone web browsing station

<p>
If you are setting up a web browsing station to run stand-alone,
without a network connection,
you should have <tt>httpd</tt> working and the web documents installed.
To tell if this is the case, enter:
<tscreen>
<verb>
lynx -dump http://localhost/
</verb>
</tscreen>
You should get the text of the home page on your system.
</p>


<sect1>Add the guest account<label id="AddGuestAccount">

<p>
As <bf>root</bf>, run <tt>adduser</tt> to add a user named <tt>guest</tt>.
Then enter
<tscreen>
<verb>
passwd guest
</verb>
</tscreen>
to set the password for the <tt>guest</tt> account.
This should be something easy to remember, like ``<tt>guest</tt>''.
You will be telling people this password.
Don't make it the same as your own password.
</p>

<p>
Then make <tt>guest</tt>'s home directory owned by you.
Enter
<tscreen>
<verb>
chown me.mygroup /home/guest
</verb>
</tscreen>
Replace ``<tt>me</tt>'' with your regular username and ``<tt>mygroup</tt>''
with your group name.
(On Red Hat Linux, these will be the same,
 since every user has his or her own group.)
</p>

<p>
You should now exit and do the rest of the steps as yourself,
not <bf>root</bf>.
</p>


<sect1>Create or edit the following files in <tt>/home/guest</tt><label id="CreateEditHomeGuestFiles">

<sect2>File name: <tt>.bash&lowbar;login</tt>

<p>
<tscreen>
<code>
exec startx
</code>
</tscreen>
This means that when <tt>guest</tt> logs in,
the login shell will start up the X Window System right away.
</p>


<sect2>File name: <tt>.Xclients</tt>

<p>
<tscreen>
<code>
netscape
</code>
</tscreen>
This means that when X starts, <tt>guest</tt> just gets the web browser,
no window manager. If you prefer another web browser, do something else.
</p>

<p>
The file <tt>.Xclients</tt> should be executable by <tt>guest</tt>.
Enter
<tscreen>
<verb>
chmod 755 /home/guest/.Xclients
</verb>
</tscreen>
to make it so.
</p>


<sect2>File name: <tt>.xsession</tt>

<p>
<tscreen>
<code>
#!/bin/sh
netscape
</code>
</tscreen>
If you use <tt>xdm</tt>(1) to log people in,
this file should make guest get the web browser
as if he or she had logged in normally.
The file <tt>.xsession</tt> should be executable by <tt>guest</tt>.
Enter
<tscreen>
<verb>
chmod 755 /home/guest/.xsession
</verb>
</tscreen>
to make it so.
</p>

This file disables blink tags, drag-to-select,
and some of the keyboard commands.
It also makes all mouse buttons do the same thing,
hides the menu bar, and makes visited and unvisited links the same color,
so each visitor gets nice clean blue links,
not ones that other people have been thumbing through and staining purple.
</p>

<p>
You should replace the <tt>NETSCAPE&lowbar;GEOMETRY</tt> in this file
with an X geometry that looks like this: <tt>XxY+0-0</tt>,
where <tt>X</tt> is the width of your screen and <tt>Y</tt> is the height
of your screen <tt>+ 32</tt>.
This will position the Netscape menu bar off the top of the screen,
so the user won't be distracted.
For example, if your screen is 800x600,
the geometry should be <tt>800x632+0-0</tt>.
</p>


<sect1>Make a <tt>.netscape</tt> directory for <tt>guest</tt>

<p>
Enter
<tscreen>
<verb>
mkdir /home/guest/.netscape
chmod 777 /home/guest/.netscape
</verb>
</tscreen>

to create <tt>guest</tt>'s <tt>.netscape</tt> directory and make it
world-writable.

</p>


<sect1>Try it

<p>
Log out, then log in as <tt>guest</tt>.
</p>


<sect1>Changing preferences

<p>
Since you won't be able to use the menu bar as <tt>guest</tt>,
you should edit guest's preferences manually if you need to change them,
or change your own preferences to what you want <tt>guest</tt>'s to be
and copy the preferences file.
</p>

<sect>NEW GUIDE:  Step-by-step guide
<p>
<sect1>Install RH
<p>
Install RedHat (further just RH) Linux on the box. Make sure shadow and MD5
passwords are enabled. And have a nice long root password! Refer to
corresponding installation guides.
<sect1>Clean-up packages
<p>
<p>RH Linux was and is *really* buggy out of the box (both local and remote exploits are
discovered every day, see <htmlurl url="http://www.securityfocus.com"
name="BugTRAQ database">), and many software packages installed by default can
be used to obtain root shell from non-privileged account or in the worst cases
across the network (or just mess up the box). Thus special attention should be given to package
selection on the browser workstation.

<itemize>
Use workstation or custom installation mode. The latter is recommended, when
selecting groups of packages, only choose <it>base-system</it>, <it>networked workstation</it>,
<it>mail/www services</it> (make sure you later replace Communicator with
Navigator) and
<it>X packages</it> and then
erase the unneeded RPMs. If using workstation mode you will have to (possibly
manually) remove about 300 packages.
<item>
When partitioning the disk follow the scheme below. The sizes are appropriate
for the 3 GB disk, scale the sizes accordingly for bigger drive but this is really
not needed for this setup as the whole Linux system is squeezed to under 200MB.
Make sure those partitions (<bf>/,/home,/var and /tmp</bf>) are present! Separate /usr
is not necessary! Remember to create a generous swap partition (at least the
size of RAM).

<p>
Partitions mount points and sizes used for a test system:

Unfortunately, some of the packages above might also be redundant and
potentially unsafe (even glibc, the main runtime Linux library, was recently
found to have locally exploitable bugs! And so was PAM module library).
More candidates for elimination
include gpm (console mouse services, had some exploit history last year) and
many others.
Xlib has a buffer overflow but can't be eliminated. Make sure the latest
version is used.
</itemize>

<sect1>Install ssh
<p>
Install ssh-server RPM for remote administration. Do NOT use inetd daemon
mode, make sshd run standalone and use <bf>/etc/hosts.allow</bf> for access
control (ssh daemon will read the file upon startup)

<sect1>Make a boot floppy
<p>
Make sure you create a boot floppy using a <bf>mkbootdisk</bf> command as errors
in LILO configuration might render the system unbootable.

<sect1>Modify configs
<p>
Make the following modifications to configuration files
<itemize>
<item>
<bf>/etc/inittab</bf>

Brief explanation for the options (see <it>man mount</it> for more)
<itemize>
<item>
For / : mounted read-only (<bf>ro</bf>), just to make it a little bit harder to do Bad Things
<item>
For <bf>/home, /tmp</bf>  and <bf> /var</bf> : <bf>nodev,noexec,nosuid</bf> will prevent (a)
starting executable from them (download and run through netscape attack),
(b)running suid executables (well, redundant in presence of the above but nice
to have too) (c)creating devices by makedev (no faked /dev/mem for kernel
module attack)
<p>
Making <bf>/home</bf> read-only might be good idea too as no netscape is not supposed
to write anything while running.

This init files are run upon entering runlevel 4 (either at reboot or when
typing <bf>init 4</bf> from root prompt). Files are run in order of increasing
numbers so that our <bf>xbrowser</bf> runs in the end.
<p>
<bf>xbrowser</bf> file looks like this
<tscreen><verb>
#!/bin/bash
# --anton: Init the box into X with browser, no login script

This file will start X server upon boot up with no prompting (after LILO
prompt). The X server will follow the directions in <it>/root/.xinitrc</it>,

Now, the <bf>DontZap</bf> is a questionable choice.  The Crtl-Alt-Backspace
sequence might be the only way to kill stuck netscape or the one with some
window overlapping netscape controls (like, View Source or View Page Info) as
no automatic netscape fixing is implemented. Disabling Java and JavaScript
will decrease the likelihood of it crashing, but will not eliminate this
miserable occurrence altogether. In the current setup pressing
Crtl-Alt-Backspace if <bf>DontZap</bf> is commented out will cause X server to
restart, killing netscape and doing a lock file cleanup.

<item>no Java (known big  risks,

restrictions),
<item>no cookies (might not be possible though, low risk),
<item>remove all launches of nonstandard applications (ideally-all applications) with
file types (by going to Netscape->Edit->Preferences->Navigator->Applications),
<item>history length set to 0 (next user can't see what previous was doing,
the risk is in seeing URL-encoded passwords sometimes)

Carefully test netscape functionality upon doing the chown to root!
At present, I have not found a way to avoid periodic Netscape complaints about
"Can't write preferences".
<p>
Another note is appropriate. Netscape is VERY buggy (last example is 
<htmlurl url="http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2000-046-02.html" name="Red Hat Linux Security Advisory">
presents a way to crash and exploit netscape using a specially crafted JPEG
image)
and is likely to crash periodically,
possibly producing a buffer overflow with shell access for the intruder. This
shell will have the netscape user as owner. Thus the absence of xterm and rxvt
on the system is absolutely crucial as it provides another line of defense.
Permission on the system should also be set very conservatively (no
world-writable files). Ideally, NO files should be owned by user "netscape" on
the system AT ALL (do a <bf>find / -user netscape </bf> command to confirm
this, also check for world writable files with <bf>find / -perm -2 ! -type l -ls</bf>).

</verb></tscreen>
The word <it>restricted</it> will cause password prompting in order to
enter non-standard runlevel (e.g. <bf>linux init 0</bf> from LILO: prompt).
<p>
That implies using stock RH 6.2 kernel. Kernel upgrade to 2.2.16 might be a
good idea as some bugs were found in early 2.2.14 kernels (low risk).
<p>
<sect1>REMOVE binaries
<p>
<bf>REMOVE /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm xterm executable COMPLETELY!</bf> This is REALLY IMPORTANT
as shell will be much harder to obtain in this case. Make sure its clone,
rxvt, is not installed! Ideally, all programs that can spawn a shell should be
removed.
