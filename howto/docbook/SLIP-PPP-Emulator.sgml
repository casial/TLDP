    <para>
     This document will describe how to get your Linux box to connect
     to a generic site via a SLIP/PPP emulator, such as SLiRP or TIA. I take no
     responsibility for your use of this information, but corrections are
     welcome.
    </para>

    <para>
     I will not attempt to describe all that can be done over this 
     connection once established, but I will refer you to other documents or 
     sites that will contain the relevant information.

<!-- Section1: How does an Emulator work?  -->

 <sect1 id="how-does-it-work">
  <title>How Does an Emulator Work?</title>

  <para>
   It is important to understand how a SLIP/PPP emulator works in
   general, to be aware of its limitations. First, you do not need to install
   the emulator on your machine. It runs on your remote host only. What you
   need on your machine is the TCP/IP and SLIP or PPP protocols installed in 
   your kernel (more on that in a bit), and some clients.
  </para>

  <para>
   Here's what happens: you send network requests from your machine
   to your remote host over the SLIP/PPP link. The emulator grabs them and
   sends them out to the Net at large. Then, incoming data is sent back from
   the Net to your account on the remote host, where the emulator grabs it
   and sends it back over the SLIP/PPP link to your machine. So, to the Net
   it appears as if you are working out of your account on the remote host,
   but to you it looks like you are really connected right to the Net.
  </para>

  <para>
   As you can see, this can confuse stuff that is incoming from the
   Net. For example, talk doesn't work via an emulator, because the incoming 
   talk request tries to start the remote hosts talk daemon, not yours.
  </para>

  <para>
   The other big difference between an emulator and real SLIP/PPP is
   you are NOT assigned your own IP address; remember, you are only
   converting a dialup account to a SLIP/PPP connection.
  </para>

 <sect2 id="what-is-tia">
   <title>What is TIA?</title>

   <para>
    <ulink url="http://www.marketplace.com/tia/tiahome.html">The Intenet Adaptor</ulink> 
    was written by the fine folks at marketplace.com. They have 
    quit working on it now, and consider it a 'mature' product. The last 
    version is 2.05; if you are going to use TIA, please get this version. 
    
    <note> <para>
      At last report, marketplace.com have gone out of business.
    </para> </note>
   </para>

 <sect2 id="what-is-slirp">
   <title>What is SLiRP?</title>

   <para>
    This is a freeware application, covered under the GNU Public 
    License. It is out of beta, and is real stable. It sports a few more 
    features than TIA, and is (reportedly) easier on host resources. 
    Available at fine Linux FTP sites everywhere.
   </para>
 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="what-about-term">
   <title>What about Term?</title>

   <para>
    If you don't have root access to your machine for one reason or
    another, and you can't persuade someone who does to install SLIP and dip,
    then you won't have much choice except to use Term. If you want to know
    more about Term, please read the HOWTO on Sunsite.
   </para>

 <sect2 id="what-about-real-slip">
   <title>What about real SLIP/PPP?</title>

   <para>
    Hey, a lot of places are offering real SLIP/PPP at reasonable 
    prices for non-dedicated dialup nowadays. If you can afford it, or feel 
    the need, go for it. The Real Thing is always better than emulation. 
    However, one of the things an emulator provides is security; it acts as 
    an impregnable firewall, and with it you are pretty much as bulletproof 
    as your provider is. You'll pay for it though, emulation is slower, and 
    does not fully support every protocol. Still and all, emulation is good 
    enough for most people, and is a fine way to connect to the Net.
   </para>
 </sect2>

<!-- Section1: Prerequisites  -->

<sect1 id="prerequisites">
   <title>Prerequisites</title>
   <para>
    Enough already! How do I set it up?
   </para>

   <para>
    Alright hotrod, we're getting there, but first there's some info 
    you need to get, and a couple of explanations.
   </para>

   <para>
    First, you need to get the IP address of your provider, if you don't 
    have it already. You can do this by typing 'who' at a shell prompt there, 
    or reading their <filename>/etc/hosts</filename>, or even just asking 
    them. While your getting 
    that, get the IP address of the POP/SMTP host and the NNTP server (if you 
    don't know what those are, trust me and ask for them anyway, you'll need 
    'em).
   </para>

   <para>
    Next, let me explain quickly about hostnames and domain names. 
    The hostname is the first part of a machines name, the domain is the rest 
    of it. Like this: hostname.domain.name (a four parter would be 
    hostname.do.main.name). Together, they make a Fully Qualified Domain 
    Name (FQDN).
   </para>

   <para>
    The name of your Linux machine is stored in 
    <filename>/etc/HOSTNAME</filename>, and 
    yes, you can change it. In fact, please do (if you're using Slackware, 
    it'll be "darkstar.frop.org" by default). Just edit the 
    <filename>/etc/HOSTNAME</filename>
    file to be whatever you want - remember, if you are using an emulator, 
    you are essentially invisible to the Net at large, so you can be 
    creative. However, if you plan to get a real SLIP/PPP connection down the 
    road sometime, you'll probably want to conform to being a sub-host of 
    your provider. For example, if your provider is "info.superhiway.com", 
    the domain is "superhiway.com" and the hostname is "info". So you could 
    either be "offramp.info.superhiway.com" or just "offramp.superhiway.com". 
    Either would work, and in either case your hostname is "offramp".

    I'll assume that you have here, for the sake of brevity. When you
    'make config', look for "Network Devices". Say 'y', of course, then say
    'y' to SLIP, CSLIP, (or PPP) and TCP/IP and 'n' to everything else, unless
    you have ethercards or need some other protocol for something else.

    DIP (Dialup Internet Protocol) is what you will use to dial up the
    remote host, start the emulator, and convert the line to SLIP/PPP. It
    comes in the "N" set of Slackware, along with a bunch of clients and
    utilities, some of which you may want to install also =). It is also
    available at

    Once you have it installed, you will need to have a dip script,

   <para>
    A word about the form of the wait and sends. If it isn't clear by 
    the example, here's what's happening:

    <variablelist>
       <varlistentry>
       <term>wait ogin: 60</term>
       <listitem> <para>
         The script will wait for the remote to send 'ogin:' for 60 
         seconds. When it gets it, the script advances. If it doesn't get 
         it, it will advance after the timeout of 60 seconds.
       </para> </listitem>
       </varlistentry>

       <varlistentry>
       <term>if $errlvl != 0 goto login_error</term>
       <listitem> <para>
       (This whole line is optional.)
        If the script is advancing because it got what it was waiting for, 
        this gets skipped. if the script is advancing because it timed out, 
	it will go to where you tell it to ('login_error1' in this case.
       </para> </listitem>
       </varlistentry>

       <varlistentry>
       <term>send "LOGIN"\n</term>
       <listitem> <para>
        DIP will send 'LOGIN' and a newline
       </para> </listitem>
       </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
   </para>

   <para>
    You can put in sleep statements if you need to, like this:
    "sleep 10" This will make the script pause for 10 seconds.
   </para>

   <para>
    After editing this file, rename it, say, remote.dip and put it in 
    <filename>/root</filename>.  Then, as root, run 
    'dip remote'. Use the -v flag the first 
    time to debug it ('dip -v remote'), this will show you all the steps 
    dip takes.
   </para>

   <para>
    Dip will only run as root, but there is a way to make it run from 
    a user account. For now, if you need this info, ask. I may include it in 
    this file later if enough people want it.
   </para>

   <para>
    If dip errors out right away, try removing the comments from the 
    script.
   </para>

</sect3>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="ppp">
   <title>PPP</title>

   <para>
    The above gets you rolling with CSLIP, which is really fine 
    most of the time. It truly is easy to get working, since the protocol is 
    supported at the kernel level - just make sure it's in there and it 
    works.
   </para>

   <para>
    However, some of you will want PPP, for what reasons, only you can
    say. I'm not going to tell you how to set it up here, there's a whole
    other HOWTO written just for that. What I will do is tell you what the 
    gotchas are when using PPP with an emulator.
   </para>

   <para>
    First, the latest version of DIP says you can use it to start PPP,
    and you can, BUT it only starts the PPP daemon - no flags, nothing. So if
    you want to use DIP to start PPP, be sure to put all of your startup info
    in the <filename>/etc/ppp/options</filename> file, or it won't work.
   </para>

   <para>
    Speaking of the options file, one of the things that MUST be in 
    there no matter how you start pppd is this: '192.0.2.1:XXX.XXX.XX.XX'. 
    What this is is 'localIPaddress:remoteIPaddress'. You need it there 
    because normally pppd can fill in the blank itself, but fails when 
    connecting to an emulator.

    Be sure to get the latest and greatest pppd package. It seems 
    there were a few versions recently that had a bit of trouble.
   </para>

   <para>
    Lastly, unless you have a good reason to use PPP, or just want to 
    learn how it works, you really don't need it. I have tried them both, and 
    didn't notice any performance difference with the standard set of 
    clients. Of course, Your Mileage May Vary. :)

   <title>Now What?</title>

   <para>
    Hey, if all went well, you are now connected to the Net! Try a 
    'telnet remotehostname' (remember that abbreviation in your hosts file?). 
    You should get the remotes telnet login prompt. Go on, try it! You can now 
    telnet/FTP/etc. anywhere on the Net from your local machine. How? Your 
    machine is using the remote as a nameserver to resolve addresses 
    (<filename>resolv.conf</filename>). Experiment, find out what works and 
    what doesn't.
   </para>

   <para>
    You will not be able to use services that are not provided 
    already on your remote host! For example, if your server doesn't allow 
    telnets, chances are you can't do it either. Why? Because the emulator is 
    only re-directing what is already available.

    My pick for 'Best Mail Reader, X Based' has to go to XFmail. This
    has now gotten out of beta, and rocks. Easy to install; requires no local
    mail system be installed (but will work with local spools) because it has
    POP built in - no more popclient/fetchpop! Easy to use; totally 
    customizable 
    from the GUI. Also supports MIME. Get it from
    <ulink url="http://burka.netvision.net.il/xfmail/xfmail.html">The XFmail Homesite</ulink>.

   <para>
    The text based News Reader
    <ulink url="ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/slrn">SLRN</ulink> is fairly simple to
    install and use.  It is a true NNTP newsreader, which means 
    <emphasis>no local news transport is required</emphasis> to make it work 
    (you don't have install
    Cnews or INN). It does require that you have access to an NNTPserver,
    naturally, but most ISPs have this. It is text based, but has
    color and mouse support, and runs fine in an rxvt window.
   </para>

   <para>
    The X based News Reader
    <ulink url="http://www.matematik.su.se/~kjj/">KNews</ulink> is 
    almost perfect. As with SLRN above, no local transport is required, but 
    an NNTP server is. It's at least worth a look.
