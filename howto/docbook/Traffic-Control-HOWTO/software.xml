    <title>Kernel requirements</title>
    <para>
      Many distributions provide kernels with modular or monolithic support
      for traffic control (Quality of Service).  Custom kernels may not
      already provide support (modular or not) for the required features.  If
      not, this is a very brief listing of the required kernel options.
    </para>
    <para>
      The user who has little or no experience compiling a kernel is
      recommended to &url-kernel-howto;.  Experienced kernel compilers should
      be able to determine which of the below options apply to the desired
      configuration, after reading a bit more about traffic control and
      planning.
    </para>

      <title>Kernel compilation options
        <footnote>
          <para>
            The options listed in this example are taken from a 2.4.20 kernel
            source tree.  The exact options may differ slightly from kernel
            release to kernel release depending on patches and new schedulers
            and classifiers.

      A kernel compiled with the above set of options will provide modular
      support for almost everything discussed in this documentation.  The user
      may need to <command>modprobe
      <replaceable>module</replaceable></command> before using a given
      feature.  Again, the confused user is recommended to the
      &url-kernel-howto;, as this document cannot adequately address questions
      about the use of the Linux kernel.

    <title>&iproute2; tools (&tc;)</title>
    <para>
      &iproute2; is a suite of command line utilities which
      manipulate kernel structures for IP networking
      configuration on a machine.  For technical documentation on these tools,
      see the &url-iproute2-docs; and for a more expository discussion, the
      documentation at &url-linux-ip.net;.  Of the tools in the &iproute2;
      package, the binary &tc; is the only one used for traffic control.  This
      HOWTO will ignore the other tools in the suite.
    </para>
    <anchor id="s-iproute2-tc"/>
    <para>
      Because it interacts with the kernel to direct the creation, deletion
      and modification of traffic control structures, the &tc; binary needs to
      be compiled with support for all of the &linux-qdisc;s you wish to use.
      In particular, the &sch_htb; qdisc is not supported yet in the upstream
      &iproute2; package.  See
      <xref linkend="qc-htb"/> for more information.
    </para>
    <para>
      The &tc; tool performs all of the configuration of the kernel structures
      required to support traffic control.  As a result of its many uses, the
      command syntax can be described (at best) as arcane.  The utility takes
      as its first non-option argument one of three Linux traffic control
      components, &linux-qdisc;, &linux-class; or &linux-filter;.

      Each object accepts further and different options, and will be

      <title>Netfilter</title>
      <para>
         Netfilter is a framework provided by the Linux kernel that allows various networking-related operations to be implemented in the form of customized handlers. Netfilter offers various functions and operations for packet filtering, network address translation, and port translation, which provide the functionality required for directing packets through a network, as well as for providing ability to prohibit packets from reaching sensitive locations within a computer network.
      </para>
      <para>
          Netfilter represents a set of hooks inside the Linux kernel, allowing specific kernel modules to register callback functions with the kernel's networking stack. Those functions, usually applied to the traffic in form of filtering and modification rules, are called for every packet that traverses the respective hook within the networking stack.
      </para>

          <para>
              iptables is a user-space application program that allows a system administrator to configure the tables provided by the Linux kernel firewall (implemented as different Netfilter modules) and the chains and rules it stores. Different kernel modules and programs are currently used for different protocols; iptables applies to IPv4, ip6tables to IPv6, arptables to ARP, and ebtables to Ethernet frames.
          </para>
          <para>
              iptables requires elevated privileges to operate and must be executed by user root, otherwise it fails to function. On most Linux systems, iptables is installed as /usr/sbin/iptables and documented in its man pages, which can be opened using man iptables when installed. It may also be found in /sbin/iptables, but since iptables is more like a service rather than an "essential binary", the preferred location remains /usr/sbin.
          </para>
          <para>
              The term iptables is also commonly used to inclusively refer to the kernel-level components. x_tables is the name of the kernel module carrying the shared code portion used by all four modules that also provides the API used for extensions; subsequently, Xtables is more or less used to refer to the entire firewall (v4, v6, arp, and eb) architecture.
          </para>
          <para>
              Xtables allows the system administrator to define tables containing chains of rules for the treatment of packets. Each table is associated with a different kind of packet processing. Packets are processed by sequentially traversing the rules in chains. A rule in a chain can cause a goto or jump to another chain, and this can be repeated to whatever level of nesting is desired. (A jump is like a “call”, i.e. the point that was jumped from is remembered.) Every network packet arriving at or leaving from the computer traverses at least one chain.

              Predefined chains have a policy, for example DROP, which is applied to the packet if it reaches the end of the chain. The system administrator can create as many other chains as desired. These chains have no policy; if a packet reaches the end of the chain it is returned to the chain which called it. A chain may be empty.

              Each rule in a chain contains the specification of which packets it matches. It may also contain a target (used for extensions) or verdict (one of the built-in decisions). As a packet traverses a chain, each rule in turn is examined. If a rule does not match the packet, the packet is passed to the next rule. If a rule does match the packet, the rule takes the action indicated by the target/verdict, which may result in the packet being allowed to continue along the chain or it may not. Matches make up the large part of rulesets, as they contain the conditions packets are tested for. These can happen for about any layer in the OSI model, as with e.g. the --mac-source and -p tcp --dport parameters, and there are also protocol-independent matches, such as -m time.

    <title>IMQ, Intermediate Queuing device</title>
    <para>
        The Intermediate queueing device is not a qdisc but its usage is tightly bound to qdiscs. Within linux, qdiscs are attached to network devices and everything that is queued to the device is first queued to the qdisc and then to driver queue. From this concept, two limitations arise:

    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                Only egress shaping is possible (an ingress qdisc exists, but its possibilities are very limited compared to classful qdiscs, as seen before).

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                A qdisc can only see traffic of one interface, global limitations can't be placed.
            </para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      IMQ is there to help solve those two limitations. In short, you can put everything you choose in a qdisc. Specially marked packets get intercepted in netfilter NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING and NF_IP_POST_ROUTING hooks and pass through the qdisc attached to an imq device. An iptables target is used for marking the packets.
    </para>
    <para>
        This enables you to do ingress shaping as you can just mark packets coming in from somewhere and/or treat interfaces as classes to set global limits. You can also do lots of other stuff like just putting your http traffic in a qdisc, put new connection requests in a qdisc, exc.

            Please note traffic is not enqueued when the target is hit but afterwards. The exact location where traffic enters the imq device depends on the direction of the traffic (in/out). These are the predefined netfilter hooks used by iptables:

    <title><constant>ethtool,</constant> Driver Queue</title>
    <para>
 The ethtool command is used to control the driver queue size for Ethernet devices. ethtool also provides low level interface statistics as well as the ability to enable and disable IP stack and driver features.
    </para>
    <para>
        The -g flag to ethtool displays the driver queue (ring) parameters (see Figure 1) :
    </para>
    <programlisting>
$ethtool -g eth0

    Ring parameters for eth0:
    Pre-set maximums:
    RX:        16384
    RX Mini:    0
    RX Jumbo:    0
    TX:        16384
    Current hardware settings:
    RX:        512
    RX Mini:    0
    RX Jumbo:    0
    TX:        256
    </programlisting>
    <para>
        You can see from the above output that the driver for this NIC defaults to 256 descriptors in the transmission queue. It was often recommended to reduce the size of the driver queue in order to reduce latency. With the introduction of BQL (assuming your NIC driver supports it) there is no longer any reason to modify the driver queue size (see the below for how to configure BQL).
    </para>
    <para>
        Ethtool also allows you to manage optimization features such as <link linkend="o-huge-packet">TSO, UFO and GSO</link>. The -k flag displays the current offload settings and -K modifies them.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
$ethtool -k eth0

    Offload parameters for eth0:
    rx-checksumming: off
    tx-checksumming: off
    scatter-gather: off
    tcp-segmentation-offload: off
    udp-fragmentation-offload: off
    generic-segmentation-offload: off
    generic-receive-offload: on
    large-receive-offload: off
    rx-vlan-offload: off
    tx-vlan-offload: off
    ntuple-filters: off
    receive-hashing: off
    </programlisting>
    <para>
        Since <link linkend="o-huge-packet">TSO, GSO, UFO</link> and GRO greatly increase the number of bytes which can be queued in the driver queue you should disable these optimizations if you want to optimize for latency over throughput. It’s doubtful you will notice any CPU impact or throughput decrease when disabling these features unless the system is handling very high data rates.
