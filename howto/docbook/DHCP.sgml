<title>DHCP protocol</title>
<para>
DHCP is Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is used to 
control vital networking parameters of hosts (running clients)
with the help of a server. DHCP is backward compatible with 
BOOTP. For more information see RFC 2131 (old RFC 1541) and 
other. (See Internet Resources section at the end of the 
document). You can also read

</para>
<para>
This mini-HOWTO covers both the DHCP _SERVER_ daemon as well as DHCP
_CLIENT_ daemon. Most people need the client daemon which is used by
workstations to obtain network information from a remote server. The server
daemon is used by system administrators to distribute network information
to clients so if you are just a regular user you need the _CLIENT_ daemon.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Client Setup</title>
<para>
Currently there are three different DHCP client programs for Linux, dhcpcd,
pump and dhclient. This mini-HOWTO deals primarily with dhcpcd.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Downloading the client daemon (dhcpcd)</title>
<para>
Depending on your distribution you might have to download the 
DHCP client daemon. If you want to compile it from the source you
package you need is called dhcpcd and the current version is 1.3.18. 
It is maintained by Sergei Viznyuk <email>sergei@phystech.com</email> and
today it comes as a binary package with most distributions.
</para>
<para>
dhcpcd source can be downloaded from following locations

</para>

<para>
This will move the old network initialization script into
<filename>rc.inet1.OLD</filename>.
You now need to create the new <filename>rc.inet1</filename> script.
Following code is all you need:
</para>

<programlisting>
#!/bin/sh
#
# rc.inet1      This shell script boots up the base INET system.

HOSTNAME=`cat /etc/HOSTNAME` #This is probably not necessary but I
                             #will leave it in anyways

# Attach the loopback device.
/sbin/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
/sbin/route add -net 127.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 lo

# IF YOU HAVE AN ETHERNET CONNECTION, use these lines below to configure the
# eth0 interface. If you're only using loopback or SLIP, don't include the
# rest of the lines in this file.

<para>
Please note that in RedHat 6.x Redhat as default includes a DHCP client called 
pump instead of above mentioned dhcpcd. CD-ROM does include dhcpcd RPM so if you
have no luck with pump try with dhcpcd. After you install dhcpcd 
(e.g. <command>rpm -i dhcpcd-1.3.17pl2-1.i386.rpm</command>)  you
will have to make some <link linkend=linuxppc-rh6>changes</link>.
</para>

<para>
Additional notes from Alexander Stevenson
<email>alexander.stevenson@home.com</email>:
</para>

<para>
I had no luck with DHCPcd. What finally worked for me was "pump", which
comes with Linux Mandrake 6.0 (and so I assume it is included with
RedHat as well). The command I used was:
</para>

<para>
<command>pump -i eth0 -h hostname</command>
</para>

<para>
It didn't matter what "hostname" was, but without it the server would
not respond.
</para>

<para>
I then changed the line in my <filename
class="directory">/sbin/ifup</filename> script to reflect the change;
the default version does not have the -h switch, and so didn't work for
me.
</para>

<para>
Basically, if you're using linuxconf, and after setting the adapter to
"DHCP" it still doesn't work, try adding a "<command>-h
hostname</command>" to the pump line in the
<filename>/sbin/ifup</filename> script. My script now looks like this:
</para>

<programlisting>
...
if [ -n "$PUMP" ]; then
    echo -n "Determining IP information for $DEVICE..."
    if /sbin/pump -i $DEVICE -h hostname; then
        echo " done."
    else
        echo " failed."
        exit 1
    fi
else ...
</programlisting>

<para>
Another more elegant way to add hostname field is provided by Aad van der Klaauw:
</para>

<para>Currently i'm configuring a gateway system at home, needed to set the
MAC address and use the '-h hostname' workaround. So I decided to
*not* change the script but to use the configure file.
In my /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 I have added the following
</para>

<programlisting>
DEVICE="eth0"
MACADDR="00:11:22:33:44:55"
DHCP_HOSTNAME="trigger_for_terayon"
</programlisting>

<para>
Which will survive upgrades, and is imho a "cleaner" way.
</para>


<para>
That is it. Reboot your machine or type <command>/sbin/ifup eth0</command> on the command line.

Removed my static ip and name from

search line and my two nameserver lines (for some reason my dhcpcd never
creates a <filename>/etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf</filename>, so I have to use
a static <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>).
</para>
<para>
In <filename>/etc/sysconfig/network</filename> I removed the HOSTNAME
and GATEWAY entries. I left the other entries as is (NETWORKING,
DOMAINNAME, GATEWAYDEV).
</para>
<para>
In <filename>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0</filename> I
removed the IPADDR, NETMASK, NETWORK, and BROADCAST entries. I left

The dhcpcd package installs it's startup script as usual for debian

<title>LinuxPPC and MkLinux</title>
<para>
Following section has been written by R. Shapiro 
</para>

<para>
As of the "1999" (R5) release, Linuxppc is now almost completely
compatible with Redhat 6, with one caveat (see below).  In general the
instructions are exactly the same as for the current release of
<link linkend=redhat6 endterm="redhat6.title"></link>.
</para>

<para>
The remaining problem is that Redhat 6 uses the 'pump' client for dhcp
by default, and 'pump' doesn't work reliably in Linuxppc.  <anchor
id="linuxppc-rh6">To get around this, you should install the latest
dhcpcd from Sergei Viznyuk, and then edit
<filename>/sbin/ifup</filename> to use <command>dhcpcd</command>
instead of <command>pump</command>.

<para>
If you have some normal number under <literal>inet addr</literal> you are set. If you see
0.0.0.0 don't despair, it is a temporary setting before
<command>dhcpcd</command> acquires
the IP address. If even after few minutes you are seeing 0.0.0.0 please
check out  <link linkend=troubleshooting
endterm="troubleshooting.title"></link>.  DHCPcd is a daemon and will
stay running as long as you have your machine on. Every three hours it
will contact the DHCP server and try to renew the IP address lease. It
will log all the messages in the syslog (on Slackware
<filename>/var/adm/syslog</filename>, RedHat/OpenLinux
<filename>/var/log/syslog</filename>).
</para>

<para>
One final thing. You need to specify your nameservers. There are two ways to do
it, you can either ask your provider to provide you with the addresses of your
name server and then put those in the
<filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> or DHCPcd will obtain
the list from the DHCP server and will build a
<filename>resolv.conf</filename> in <filename
class="directory">/etc/dhcpc</filename>.
</para>
<para>
I decided to use DHCPcd's <filename>resolv.conf</filename> by doing the following:
</para>

<para>
Back up your old <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>: <command>mv /etc/resolv.conf
/etc/resolv.conf.OLD</command>
</para>

<para>
If directory <filename class="directory">/etc/dhcpc</filename> doesn't
exist create it: <command>mkdir /etc/dhcpc</command>
</para>

<para>
Make a link from <filename>/etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf</filename> to
<filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>: <command>ln -s
/etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf</command>
</para>

<para>
If that doesn't work try this (fix suggested by
<email>nothing@cc.gatech.edu</email> with a little amendment by Henrik
Stoerner): 
</para> 

<anchor id="error3">
<para>
This last step I had to perform only because my dhcpcd doesn't
create an <filename>/etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf</filename>.  In <filename

made the following changes (which are a very poor hack, but they work
for me): 
</para>

    /sbin/dhcpcd -c /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifdhcpc-done ${DEVICE}
    echo "echo \$$ > /var/run/dhcp-wait-${DEVICE}.pid; exec sleep 30" | sh

    if [ -f /var/run/dhcp-wait-${DEVICE}.pid ]; then
	^^^^
        echo "failed."

by your Linux system. If you have a generic ethernet card (a NE2000 clone) you
should have received a disk with DOS utilities that you can use to set up
the card. Try playing with IRQs until Linux recognizes your card (IRQ
9,10,12 are usually good).

<title>My ethernet card is recognized during boot up but I still get "NO

card.</title>
<para>
You need to make sure that you have the 10BaseT port ("phone" plug) on
your network card activated. Best way to verify it is to check what kind
of connector your card is configured for during bootup e.g.
</para>

<programlisting>
eth0: 3c509 at 0x300 tag 1, 10baseT port, address  00 20 af ee 11 11, IRQ 10.

3c509.c:1.07 6/15/95 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov
</programlisting>

<para>
I have received reports of laptop users having this kind of problems due
to the PCMCIA utilities (specifically ifport) that would set the
connector type to 10Base2 (thinnet). You have to make sure you use 10BaseT
for your connection. If you are not reconfigure the card and restart the
computer.

<title>My DHCP client broadcasts requests but no one answers

<para>
On some systems, you need to include some hostname for your machine as
part of the request.  With dhcpcd, do this with <command>dhcpcd -h
<replaceable>foohost</replaceable></command>
Probably the hostname wanted will be your account username on the network.

<title>I have followed all the steps but still my machine is not able to

<para>
The cable modem will usually memorize the ethernet address of your
network card so if you connect a new computer or switch network cards you
will somehow have to "teach" your cable modem to recognize the new
computer/card. Usually you can turn of the modem and bring it back up
while computer is on or you will have to call tech support and tell them
that you have changed a network card in the computer.

You have firewall rules (ipfwadm rules) that disallow port 67/68

<title>Alternative DHCP client (ISC dhclient)</title>
<para>
If you have not had success getting your Linux connection running with
the dhcpcd you might want to try ISC dhclient. dhclient comes with
the DHCP distribution from ISC which includes both a DHCP client
and a DHCP server. Instructions on how to get and compile 
the DHCP distribution can be found <link linkend=dhcpserver>here</link>. 
When you are done with it please return to this section to configure
the client.
</para>

<note>
<para>
Following information has been provided by 
Ted Lemon <email>mellon@isc.org</email>
one of the authors of dhclient.
</para>
</note>

<para>
With the current version of the DHCP client,
you don't actually need a <filename>dhclient.conf</filename>. All you
have to do is invoke dhclient e.g.: <command>/sbin/dhclient</command>.
</para>

<para>
This will configure all broadcast interfaces. If this doesn't
work or you want to specify only one interface create a
<filename>/etc/dhclient.conf</filename> file with this example
configuration.
</para>

<programlisting>
interface "eth0" {
  send dhcp-client-identifier 1:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx;
  send dhcp-lease-time 86400;
}
</programlisting>

<para>
Here we assume that the ethernet interface is eth0. If not
change accordingly. Also replace xx:xx:xx:xx:xx with your ethernet 
address. This dhclient.conf makes the client look more 
like a Win95 client.

<title id="dhcpserver.title">DHCP server for UNIX</title>
<para>
There are several DHCP servers available for U*X-like OSes,
both commercial and free. One of the more popular free DHCP servers
is Paul Vixie/ISC DHCPd. Currently the latest version is 2.0 (suggested
for most users) but 3.0 is in beta testing.  You can get them from 
</para>

<para>
<ulink
url="ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/dhcp/">ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/dhcp/</ulink>
</para>

<para>
Some of the distributions provide binary packages for dhcpd so
skip the following section if you got it installed that way.
</para>

<para>
After you download unpack it. After you do cd into the
distribution directory and type: <command>./configure</command>
</para>

<para>
It will take some time to configure the settings. After it is done type:
<command>make</command> and <command>make install</command>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>DHCP server configuration</title>
<para>
When done with installation type <command>ifconfig -a</command>. You
should see something like this:
</para>

<programlisting>
eth0      Link encap:10Mbps Ethernet  HWaddr 00:C0:4F:D3:C4:62
          inet addr:183.217.19.43  Bcast:183.217.19.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

          TX packets:218647 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0
          Interrupt:11 Base address:0x210
</programlisting>

<para>
If it doesn't say MULTICAST you should reconfigure your
kernel and add multicast support. On most systems you will not 
need to do this.
</para>

<para>
Next step is to add route for 255.255.255.255. Quoted from DHCPd README:
</para>

<blockquote>
<para>
"In order for dhcpd to work correctly with picky DHCP clients 
(e.g., Windows 95), it must be able to send packets with an 
IP destination address of 255.255.255.255.  Unfortunately, 
Linux insists on changing 255.255.255.255 into the local 
subnet broadcast address (here, that's 192.5.5.223).  This 
results in a DHCP protocol violation, and while many DHCP 
clients don't notice the problem, some (e.g., all Microsoft
DHCP clients) do.  Clients that have this problem will appear 
not to see DHCPOFFER messages from the server."
</para>
</blockquote>

<para>
Type: <command>route add -host 255.255.255.255 dev eth0</command>
</para>

<para>
If you get a message "<literal>255.255.255.255: Unknown host</literal>",
you should try adding the following entry to your
<filename>/etc/hosts</filename> file:
</para>

<programlisting>
255.255.255.255 all-ones
</programlisting>

<para>
Then, try:
</para>

<programlisting>
route add -host all-ones dev eth0
</programlisting>

<para>
or
</para>

<programlisting>
route add 255.255.255.0 dev eth0
</programlisting>

<para>
<literal>eth0</literal> is of course the name of the network device you
are using.  If it differs change appropriately.
</para>

<title>Options for DHCPd</title>
<para>
Now you need to configure DHCPd. In order to do this you
will have to create or edit <filename>/etc/dhcpd.conf</filename>. There
is a graphical interface for dhcpd configuration under KDE ( <ulink
url="http://www.kde.org/">http://www.kde.org/</ulink> ) called kcmdhcpd
that is very similar to the DHCP configurator on Windows NT. When KDE
2.0 comes out it should come with kcmdhcpd or you could get it directly
from:
</para>

<para>
<ulink
url="ftp://ftp.us.kde.org/pub/kde/unstable/apps/network/">ftp://ftp.us.kde.org/pub/kde/unstable/apps/network/</ulink>
</para>

<para>
If you want to configure it by hand follow instructions below.
</para>

<para>
Most commonly what you want to do is assign IP addresses randomly. This
can be done with settings as follows:
</para>

<programlisting>
# Sample /etc/dhcpd.conf
# (add your comments here) 
default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;
option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
option broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;
option routers 192.168.1.254;
option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2;
option domain-name "mydomain.org";

subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
   range 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.100;
   range 192.168.1.150 192.168.1.200;
}
</programlisting>

<para>
This will result in DHCP server giving a client an IP address
from the range 192.168.1.10-192.168.1.100 or 
192.168.1.150-192.168.1.200. It will lease an IP address for
600 seconds if the client doesn't ask for specific time
frame. Otherwise the maximum (allowed) lease will be 7200 seconds. The
server will also "advise" the client that it should use 255.255.255.0 as
its subnet mask,  192.168.1.255 as its broadcast address, 192.168.1.254 as
the router/gateway and 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2 as its DNS servers.
</para>

<para>
If you need to specify a WINS server for your Windows clients you
will need to include the <literal>netbios-name-servers</literal> option e.g.
</para>

<programlisting>
option netbios-name-servers 192.168.1.1;
</programlisting>

<para>
You can also assign specific IP addresses based on clients
ethernet address e.g. 
</para>

<programlisting>
host haagen {
   hardware ethernet 08:00:2b:4c:59:23;
   fixed-address 192.168.1.222;
}
</programlisting>

<para>
This will assign IP address 192.168.1.222 to a client with ethernet
address 08:00:2b:4c:59:23.
</para>

<para>
You can also mix and match e.g. you can have certain clients getting
"static" IP addresses (e.g. servers) and others being alloted
dynamic IPs (e.g. mobile users with laptops). There are a number of other
options e.g. nis server addresses, time server addresses etc., if you
need any of those options please read the
<filename>dhcpd.conf</filename> man page.
</para>

</sect2>



<sect2>
<title>Starting the server</title>
<para>
There is only one thing to do before starting the server. In most cases
DHCP installation doesn't create a <filename>dhcpd.leases</filename>
files. This file is used by DHCPd to store information about current
leases. It is in the plain text form so you can view it during the
operation of DHCPd. To create <filename>dhcpd.leases</filename> type: 

<programlisting>
touch /var/state/dhcp/dhcpd.leases
</programlisting

</para>

<para>
This will create an empty file (file size = 0).
Some of the older version of dhcpd 2.0 placed the file in
<filename>/etc/dhcpd.leases</filename>.  You do not need to make any
changes to the leases file it will be manipulated by the dhcpd.  If you
get a message saying that file exists simply ignore it and go to the
next step.
</para>

<para>
You can now invoke the DHCP server. Simply type (or include in the bootup
scripts)
</para>

<programlisting>
/usr/sbin/dhcpd
</programlisting>

<para>
This will invoke dhcpd on eth0 device. If you want to invoke it
on another device simply supply it on the command line e.g.
</para>

<programlisting>
/usr/sbin/dhcpd eth1
</programlisting>

<para>
To verify that everything is working fine you
should first turn on the debugging mode and put the server
in foreground. You can do this by typing
</para>

<programlisting>
/usr/sbin/dhcpd -d -f
</programlisting>

<para>
Then boot up one of your clients and check out the console of your server. 
You will see a number of debugging messages come up. If everything works out
fine you are done :-). Quit dhcpd and start it without the
<command>-d</command> <command>-f</command> and arguments. If you want
dhcpd to start at boot-up include dhcpd in e.g.
</para>

<programlisting>
/etc/rc.d/rc.local
