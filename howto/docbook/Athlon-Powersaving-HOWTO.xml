         How to enable the power-saving functionality of the 
	 Athlon/Duron/AthlonXP processor on some motherboards/chipsets. 
	 This is usefull for saving Power and lowering the Temperature of the
	 CPU and the System. (It also will reduce noise if you use temperature
	 controlled fans in your case/on your cpu heatsink).

  <title>Basics on the Athlon Power Saving Mode</title>
  <para>
   The HLT signal which is used by the normal idle-loop of the Linux kernel 
   doesn't normaly bring any significant power-saving on processors of the Athlon/Duron 
   family (hereafter referred to as Athlon processors). To get real power-saving on an 
   Athlon processor, you have to put the processor in the STPGNT-Mode (Stop Grant Mode). 
   In this mode, the processor is disconnected from the front-side bus (FSB), and can 
   turn off parts of the CPU as well as reduce the clock to save power.
  </para>
  <para>
   Some modern Motherboards/Chipsets also support a Function to make a STPGNT when a HLT   signal is detected.

<sect1 id="approaches">
  <title>The Different Approaches</title>
   
  <para>
     In the following section I present different approaches to achieve the same goal: 
     power-saving on your Athlon/Athlon-XP based system. My recommended approach at the 
     moment is to use the <quote>command-line hack</quote> or the athcool programm (the kernel patch 
     is outdated and will not be developed any further, and the 
     LVCool patch supports only one chipset family.) 
  </para>
  <para>
     Nearly all of these approaches will set the <quote>
     Disconnect enable when STPGNT detected</quote> bit 
     in the north bridge of the chipset. All other work is done by the ACPI subsystem of 
     the kernel which sends a STPGNT signal to the processor, when it enters the acpi-c2 idle 
     mode. 
  </para>

  <para>
     If you haven't already got a kernel with ACPI support, you have to enable it in
     the kernel setup and then recompile the new kernel. You'll find the 
     ACPI-options under <menuchoice><guimenu>General Setup</guimenu><guimenu>Power Management Setup</guimenu><guimenuitem>ACPI</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. You must have at least the following options: <guimenuitem>ACPI Bus Manager</guimenuitem>, <guimenuitem>System</guimenuitem> and <guimenuitem>Processor.</guimenuitem>
  </para>
  <para>
     Or for the new 2.4.22 Kernel: <menuchoice><guimenu>General Setup</guimenu><guimenu>ACPI Support</guimenu></menuchoice>. You must have at least the following option: <guimenuitem>Processor</guimenuitem>.
  </para>
  <para>2.6.x Kernel: <menuchoice><guimenu>Powermanagment options</guimenu><guimenu>ACPI</guimenu></menuchoice>. You must have at least the option  <guimenuitem>Processor</guimenuitem> enabled. You shouldn't enable Thermal Zone !! 
  </para>

  <para>
     Some Chipsets also support a STPGNT if a HLT signal is detected. This Motherboards/Chipsets
     don't need ACPI to be enabled! At the moment i look for feedback which Chipsets work without
     ACPI and which need ACPI. Maybee you could test it on your Motherboard and send me a mail. 
     (see <xref linkend="testing" />)
  </para>

<sect2 id="commandline">
  <title>The Command-line Hack (recommended)</title>
      
  <para>
     To use the command-line hack you normaly have to enable ACPI in the kernel, otherwise it is mentioned. No reboot is needed to enable the Powersaving. You could enable/disable it from the command line with this commands:

     The patch is based on another patch (from Jan Niehusmann) I found on the

     By the way, my patch does the same as the command-line hack, except that 
     the Patch does it from 
     within the kernel. This is why I recommend using the command-line hack,  
     which is really simple to use and you don't have to modify your kernel.

     Here</ulink> is another Powersaving program which supports several chipsets. I didn't test it
     by myself but i heared it works. Check it out ... There is also a program provided with 
     which you could use the onboard monitoring chips on some motherboards 
     (like the lm-sensors package).

  <title>AMD 760MP Powersaving</title>

  <para>
     There is a kernel module which enables powersaving on the 760MP multiprocessor chipset. You 
     could find it       
     <ulink url="http://www.muru.com/linux/amd-smp-idle/">
     here</ulink>. I don't know how good it works, but i got at least one mail from someone
     who said it works for him. So check it out.

  <title>How to test whether it works</title>
  <para>
     Ok ... you use one of the described powersaving possibilitys and you want to verify, whether
     it works. Here are two ways to check it:
  </para>
  <para>
     If you have temperature controlled Fan on your CPU-Heatsink, you could check for the noise level of the Fan to see whether it works or not. After a few idle minutes you give the CPU somthing to do.
  <tip>
    <procedure>
       <title>I normaly do it like this:</title>
    <step>
      <para>
        get superuser (root)
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
       <command>cd /usr/src/linux</command>
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
         and give the computer something to do: <command>while true; do make clean; make bzImage; done</command>
      </para>
    </step>
    </procedure>
  </tip>
  After about 20 or 30 seconds you should notice that the noise of the fan is getting louder while the fan is getting faster. Don't forget to end the while-loop after some time ( a few minutes) with STRG-C.
  </para>
  <para>
     The same procedure as above works also with a monitoring program for the cpu-temperature (like <ulink url="http://secure.netroedge.com/~lm78/">lm-sensors</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.nt.phys.kyushu-u.ac.jp/shimizu/download/download.html">xmbmon</ulink> and <ulink url="http://www.tinet.org/~com.ea/rtsensors/">rtsensors</ulink>).

<sect2 id="bugs">
  <title>Known Bugs/Problems</title>
  
  <para>There are two known bugs in the Athlon/Duron processor. This is number 
  11 and number 14 in the <citetitle>AMD Athlon Processor Revision Guide</citetitle>. It looks like the Athlon XP is significantly less often affected by these bugs. So if you have an Athlon XP you are on the lucky side (like me).</para>

  <para>There could be following problems (caused by the bugs):
  <itemizedlist>

  </para>

  <para>Sometimes a BIOS-update will help (it exists as a workaround for 
  bug 11, which could be done by the BIOS). But as far as I know there are 
  only a few boards out there which have this workaround in the BIOS.</para>

  <para>For the Asus A7V133-C, it is known that the BIOS-option <option>PCI master read caching</option> will solve most problems when it is enabled. So look
  at your BIOS to see whether it has such functionality.</para>
  <para>It is also known that on some boards, the BIOS option <option>Delayed Transaction</option> solves some of the problems. You may want to give this option a try too.</para>
  <para>WARNING:  On boards with KT133A, this could enable the famous VIA-Southbridge bug!</para>
  <para>From a Newsnet post, regarding Asus A7V:
  <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
        <para>without delayed transaction: sound-skips and TV-skips</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
        <para>with delayed transaction: no sound skips and only slight TV problems</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
        <para>with delayed transcation and master read caching: nearly no TV problems and no sound skips at all</para>
     </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>There are other causes for problems:
  <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
        <para>the PSU is not strong enough to handle the fluctuations in the power consumption of the processor/motherboard</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
        <para>some motherboard voltage-regulators could have the same problems like the PSU ;)</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
        <para>you have a K7S5A (as far as I know, this board could be really wierd when power-saving is enabled)</para>
     </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
     If you have minor problems with power-saving enabled, and nevertheless want to use 
     power-saving, you can enable the power-saving by default, and turn it off if you
     want to playback music, watch TV, ...

<sect2 id="fix">
  <title>Fix for sound skips and other problems</title>  
  <para>Thank you to Michael Hamilton for submitting me the idea how it works.</para> 
  <para>The working of this Fix was confirmed by two People, so it looks like it works, but it may not work for everyone. Please feel free to submit further experiences!</para>
  <para>Lets go: It looks like at least the sound skips are curable by maximizing the pci latency timer of the device.</para>
  <para>First you have to find the "pci-address" of your Soundcard. This could be done with <command>lspci</command>. You have to look for something like "Multimedia audio controller" or "AudioPCI". Take the "pci-address" of the device (looks like something like that: 01:06.0 -> it stands for: bus:slot.function) and maximize the latency timer for it. This is done by setpci:</para>
<para><command>setpci -v -s "pci-address" latency_timer=ff</command></para>
<para>For additional Information on the Latency Timer you could look <ulink url="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-hw2.html">here.</ulink></para>
<para>Maybe this works also for other problems like USB-Problems and Harddisk-Transfer-Slowdowns, but this hasn't been tested for now. Feel free to test it (but don't blame me, if it doesn't work or makes everything worse) and report whether it works. The problem is, that i have none of this problems and so can't test this by myself.</para>
<para>If it works, you have to perform this setpci command at every startup/reboot of the Computer. So it would be wise to put it in one of the init-scripts (after the driver module is loaded!).</para>
