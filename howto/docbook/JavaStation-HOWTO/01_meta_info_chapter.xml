<title>The Purpose of this Document</title>

<para>
This document is to serve as a comprehensive HOWTO and <acronym>FAQ</acronym> 
collection regarding the <productname>Sun JavaStation <acronym>NC</acronym>
</productname> and enabling the <application><acronym>GNU</acronym>/Linux 
<acronym>OS</acronym> </application> on it.
</para>
 
<para>
The intended audience of this document is anyone who has an interest
in enabling <application>Linux</application> on the <productname>Sun 
JavaStations</productname>.  The document structure is laid out to 
serve as either a top-to-bottom read for a newcomer, or as quick 
reference on a single topic for advanced users.  Pointers
to sample files submitted by users are included for 
extremely hurried readers.
</para>

<para>
The author of this document is Robert Dubinski 
<email>rsd@dubinski-family.org</email>.  Robert is the former 
computer technician and UNIX systems administrator for 
<ulink url ="http://www.marquette.edu">Marquette University's</ulink> 
<ulink url="http://www.mscs.mu.edu"> Math, Statistics and Computer 
Science Department</ulink>, where he had 
125 <productname>JavaStations</productname> running 
<application>Linux</application>.  These machines were 
all configured using the information, techniques and files 
presented in this document.
</para>

<para>
In early 1999, Eric Brower  <email>ebrower@usa.net</email> wrote the 
first informal HOWTO for the <productname>JavaStation</productname>.  Parts 
of this document are inspired by his work, and all unique information 
presented there have since been merged into this document.  Eric's 
original mini-HOWTO is saved for posterity at:
<ulink 
url = "http://dubinski-family.org/~jshowto/Files/texts/eric_brower_js_howto_19980218.txt">

This HOWTO also aims to serve as a member document of the Linux Documentation
Project.  The <acronym>LDP</acronym> can be reached at:

The HOWTO author wishes to give a second thank-you to Pete 
and Eric for their work:
</para>
 
<blockquote>
<attribution>Robert Dubinski, March 2000</attribution>

<para>
Pete got me going with <application>Linux</application> on the 
<productname>JavaStation</productname> in December 1998, has 
been the main kernel programmer adding in support for the 
<productname>JavaStation</productname> line, and despite his busy 
work schedule was nice enough to find time to answer all my email 
queries for help over the last 15 months. 
</para>

<para>
Eric worked on bringing <application>X</application> support to the 
<productname>JavaStation</productname> when it had none.
He had been working on a dedicated server for the <productname>
JavaStation</productname> in early 1999, and kept me informed of 
his progress.  In mid-1999, he switched tactics and sent a working 
framebuffer example to test out.  He also wrote the first comprehensive 
mini-HOWTO for the <productname>JavaStations</productname>, 
answered my email questions, and got me interested in the embedded
solution which I employ here at Marquette.
</para>

<para>
Thank-you Pete and Eric!

                   Many major changes: restructured for better layout,
                   new chapters added, updated files and file pointers,
                   new master distribution location, source broken into 
                   parts, new sample files, md5sums on all sample files,
                   overall update and proofread of materials.  Thank-you 
                   very much to Simon Kuhn for donating an old Sun4 to 
                   enable more sample files be made.  Thank-you also to
                   Nate Carlson for donating sample kernels (unfortunately 
                   that info was lost during a disk crash...Nate, please
                   contact me.).  If anyone contributed items between

        <revremark>This is called the "@#!$?" release.  It is
                   called such because there were some small-mid
                   size changes to the document which were lost
                   in a disk failure, prior to me re-uploading to
                   the LDP site.  To give you an idea of how bad
                   the situation was, the last version I had on
                   backup was in Docbook SGML, while I had switched
                   to Docbook XML many months prior.  Simply put,
                   any contributed changes or email contacts I had
                   with contributors were lost, and are hopefully on
                   their way back in with this release.   If you 
                   contributed something, and it disappeared, please
                   contact me immediately, and it'll get back in. --RSD
