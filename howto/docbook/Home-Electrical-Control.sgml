		<para>Many people asked me, "Is it possible to control some electrical
			stuff [e.g. lights, radio, tv, etc.] by using a home computer?" The answer is YES. 
			The process is very easy, and anyone can do it.</para>
		<para>After I read the Coffee Machine Mini-HOWTO, I got an idea of how to control 
			my home electrical appliances. I made some modifications on the circuit discussed in that 
			Coffee Machine Mini-HOWTO, and wrote a simple program. The circuit can 
			control many small electrical devices.^_^ You can use <command>crontab</command>
			to set your lights to come on automatically or to turn on your airconditioner.  I use it to control my VCR and VCD ( I do still need some modification on VCR/VCD).
			By writing a simple program, you can control everything over the web. You can use 
			telnet with SSH and your telephone dial in to control all the appliances you have on the circuit.</para>
		<para>This circuit is VERY SIMPLE. Even if you don't know anything
			about circuits, you can set up this circuit.</para>

		<title>System Requirement</title>
		<para>Get any computer that is running Linux and has a working parallel port. :)
			I'm using a 386DX with 4MB RAM 40MB HD.
			You will need gcc to compile the program. If you want to use telnet or SSH,
			you will also need <application>telnetd</application> or <application>sshd</application>. You can write your own 
			program by using <application>ioperm</application> and <application>outb</application>. If you would like to 
			use my program, you will need g++.</para>
		<para>Click the following link to download my program. You will need g++ to compile it.

		<para>The data line of the parallel port can provide between 0 and 5 volts.
			Therefore, we can use this line to control a relay and let that relay control
			an electrical device.</para>

P Ground			parallel port ground (pin 18 to pin 25, use any)

Vcc				depends on the type of your relay. I'm using 12VDC

Relay Ground	the ground for 12VDC

4.7k				4.7K resistor

NPN				C2235 NPN transistor

1N4002			1N4002 diode

LED				light emitting diode

relay				a coil relay</programlisting>
	
		<para>+5 volts from parallel port will turn on the relay. Once the relay is on,
			the device connected to that relay will be on. When the parallel port's data
			line goes back to 0, it will turn off the relay, and device is off.</para>

			<para>Some relays may have more that 5 pins. More pins just means there are more switches.</para>
				<para>I wrote a simple program that can control 8 relays. The program is available at the following location and

				<para>A complete circuit can control up to eight relays, that means that a complete circuit can control
				eight different devices. You will need a DB25 connector. Using a parallel
				switch cable, connect this relay board to your computer. I put the relay board in a box 
				and use a parallel switch cable to connect it to my Linux box:</para>

			To connect the system, just connect your home electrical device to the power outlet. That is it!
			You don't need to make any change on the electrical device. And you can
