<sect1 id="LinuxOS">
      <title>The Linux Operating System</title>
      <para>The Linux operating system has many software applications and utilities that run in the non-graphical environment. The
      graphical user interface (GUI), which is often referred to as X Windows, is clearly separate from the underlying
      non-graphical, text-only environment. One major reason that a visually impaired individual can use Linux is that network
      connectivity is built in to the operating system and provides full access to the Internet from the non-graphical interface. 
      All visible text on the screen can be translated using a screen reader and speech synthesizer.</para>

      <para>Over the past few years many improvements have been made to the GUI, and many of the desktops now 
      provide features and enhancements designed for accessibility. In the following sections you will find information on the tools,
      utilities, and applications that are available to assist users in configuring their desktop environment.</para>

   <sect2>
      <title>Assistive Technologies Available for Linux</title>
      <para>Assistive technologies are computer hardware devices and software applications that provide individuals with impairments
      access to the information and applications on a computer. Although there are not many commercial applications available
      specifically for Linux accessibility, there are free software applications that can make the computer more accessible.   
      Detailed information on assistive technologies that are available has been listed in this document based on the type of 
      disability.</para> 
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
      <title>Usability</title>
      <para>Linux has the advantage over Windows that a large majority of Linux software has been developed for the console. Although
      many programs are now being developed for the GUI, programs continue to be written for the non-graphical, 
      text-based environment. Linux originated as a programmer's operating system and, for the physically disabled, this means that it 
      is easy to build and customize programs to suit an individual's needs.</para>
 
      <para>The windowing system used by Linux (X11) includes many programming tools that enable further modification and customization 
      of the GUI. KDE and GNOME have included many accessibility and usability features in their latest
      releases and are continuing to test, upgrade, and enhance the graphical environment. The following are links to KDE and GNOME's
      accessibility and usability projects:</para>

<sect1 id="visual">
      <title>Visual Impairments</title>
      <para>There are two categories of visual impairments. Individuals who are partially sighted (for example, blurred vision, near
      and far-sightedness, color blindness) and those who are totally blind. Assistive technologies are available for the Linux
      operating system for visually impaired users, and many of the software packages are free.</para>

      <title>Technologies for the Visually Impaired</title> 
      <para>The following is a list of assistive technologies for visually impaired users:</para>
      <sect3><title>Screen Readers</title>
      <para>Screen readers are software applications that are installed on the computer to provide translation of the information 
      on the computer screen to an audio output format. The translation is passed to the speech synthesizer and the words are spoken
      out loud. Currently, fully functional screen readers are only available for Linux in console mode. This section describes some of 
      the most common screen readers.</para>

      <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para><emphasis role="strong">Emacspeak </emphasis>is the complete Audio Desktop is an excellent non-graphical, text

      <sect3><title>Speech Synthesizers</title>
      <para>Speech synthesizers can be a hardware device or a text to speech (TTS) software application that creates the sounds 
      necessary to provide speech output. Hardware synthesizers are available for the Linux operating system; however, they can 
      be very expensive and must be compatible with the screen reader application in order to function properly. The alternative is to 
      download and install a software synthesizer such as IBM's ViaVoice or Festival and configure the application to a compatible
      screen reader, such as Emacspeak.</para>

      <sect4><title>Hardware Speech Synthesizers</title>
      <para>A hardware speech synthesizer is a device that is connected to the computer's serial or parallel port and translates the
      text to a spoken output. Normally there are Braille labels on all controls to indicate the off and on position, and volume 
      control. Hardware synthesizers also have the ability to speak in different tones that can be setup to indicate various parts of a
      document or text. Some models will provide a connection for headphones. The following is a list of speech
      synthesizers that are supported on the Linux operating system and can be used with Emacspeak: </para>

      <para>Cognitive and language impairments include dyslexia and problems with; memory, comprehension, problem solving,
      and written language. 
      For many individuals with cognitive and language disabilities, complex graphical displays and inconsistent use of words 
      can make using the computer more difficult. 
      A user with epilepsy can have a seizure from an application with blinking lights and animation. Most desktops now allow users to
      disable animation. Web browsers such as Mozilla and Netscape allow users to disable graphics. It is important to 
      check the documentation for preferences that are available in the desktop environment you are using, 
      as well as any applications that are 
      used. This section discusses the tools that are available to aid users with these impairments:
