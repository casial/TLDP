<sect1 id="intro"> <title>Introduction</title>
<indexterm><primary>>disk!introduction</primary></indexterm>

<para> This document was written to assist the reader in setting up and
configuring TV tuner cards based on the Bt848 or Bt878 chipsets in the Linux
operating system.

It outlines how to enable the necessary kernel and/or software support and
various television applications and software methods of capture usable with your device.

While there is some attempt to catalog individual cards and features in <xref linkend="mfgr">, 
the ultimate best source of information about your card and its capabilities will be 
found in the printed manual that came with your device or the manufacturer's website.</para>

<sect2 id="conventions"> <title>Conventions Used in this Document</title>

<para> The following conventions are used in this document and are
outlined here for those who may not yet have a complete understanding
of how to access and control the underlying operating system in Linux, 
which is usually via the Bash shell.  </para>

<para> First, filenames are referenced in a paragraph like so:
<filename>/path/file</filename> </para>

<para> Commands in Linux are executed (or 'called') at the command prompt,
otherwise known as the 'command line.'

If you are in the non-graphical (text-based) environment, you will usually
be presented with the Bash shell prompt which is a dollar sign: </para>

<para>
<screen>
   $</screen>
</para>

<para>
	...or the hash mark:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
   #</screen>
</para>

<para> ...if you have logged in as root or have otherwise acquired root, or
'superuser' privileges.

You can also access the Bash shell in the X window
system, otherwise known as X or X11, with an <ulink
url="http://invisible-island.net/xterm/">xterm</ulink> or similar
X-terminal-emulator.

Commands to be performed at the Bash prompt, but referenced in a paragraph
of this document, usually look like this: <command>do this now</command>
</para>
<para> Commands and/or the resulting output of commands may also be
outlined with screen output in their own paragraph or heading: </para>

<para>
<screen>
   $ date
   Sun Jul 27 22:37:11 CDT 2003</screen> </para>

<para>
	When a command is written in front of the Bash prompt (e.g.,
	<command>$ date</command> above), it is assumed the [Return]
	or [Enter] key has been pressed after the command, possibly
	followed by the output on a new line as shown in the preceding example.</para>

<title>The BTTV Hardware</title>

<sect2 id="about">
<title>Bttv Basics</title>
<para>
If you haven't figured it out by now, this document deals with the Linux-specific 
configuration of frame grabber cards that include the 
<ulink url="http://www.conexant.com">Conexant</ulink> Bt848 and related family
of video decoder chips, collectively referred to as the <quote>Bt8x8</quote> chipset. 
You can probably see the Bt8x8 chip (it's usually labelled as such) embedded on your 
TV card upon inspection, in addition to other chips which you should probably make note of 
before installation in case there are problems later.
The <quote>Bt</quote> stands for Brooktree, after the original manufacturer of 
the chipset, now a part of Conexant. The Bt8x8 family has enjoyed remarkable longevity in a world where
<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore's Law</ulink> is the rule,
the first ISA boards manufactured in the mid-1990s. There are several chips in this family, including the Bt848, 
Bt848A, Bt849, Bt878 and Bt879, and as a rule are all supported by the 
<ulink url="http://linux.bytesex.org/v4l2/bttv.html">BTTV driver</ulink> for which 
this document is named.</para>

<para>In addition to the Bt8x8 decoder chip, these cards vary by accompanying components such as the tuner and sound decoder, and may include an optional videotext decoder, radio tuner, and/or hardware mpeg encoder.</para>

<para>Note that the next generation of bt8x8, the 
<ulink url="http://linux.bytesex.org/v4l2/cx88.html">
Conexant 2388x</ulink>, is now supported by a driver in the Linux 2.6 kernel. The configuration 
of hardware with that chipset is beyond the scope of this document (but similar).</para> 

<para>In general, any PCI card with a Bt8x8 chipset should work with the Linux Bttv driver. 
TV cards known NOT to work include the following:</para>
<para>
<itemizedlist spacing=compact>
    <listitem><para>Cards with a Zoran 36057/36067 PCI controller chipset, which are instead 
 supported by <ulink url= "http://mjpeg.sf.net/driver-zoran/">this driver</ulink>,
 and includes the following models:</para>
<itemizedlist spacing=compact>
     <listitem><para>Iomega Buz</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>Pinnacle DC10+</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Hexium HV-PCI6, Orion or Gemini framegrabber cards</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Any ISA-based TV card</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>If you are uncertain which chipset your TV card has, use the <command>lspci</command> command. 
An example of such output for a Bt8x8 card might look similar to the following:</para>
<screen>
   0000:02:0a.0 Multimedia video controller: Brooktree Corporation Bt878 Video 
      Capture (rev 02)

      (rev 02)
</screen>
<para>A list of hardware (mostly PCI cards) compatible with the Bttv driver is found in <xref linkend="cards"></para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="soundconn">
<title>The Sound Output</title>
<para>
Your card may have come with a short external audio connector with two male ends. 
This is for connecting your Bttv audio out to your sound card's input jack so you 
won't require an extra set of speakers. Some cards may also have a 4-pin socket for 
output of your Bt8x8 audio signals directly to your sound card within your computer 
case. You can connect this to your "CDROM" input with reasonable certainty that you 
will be able to control the input with your mixer from your primary sound card as 
well as record (see <xref linkend="recording"> for more information on recording). 
Alternatively you can use external speakers connected to the line out of your Bt8x8 card.

<title>Enabling Support for Your Bt8x8 Hardware in Linux</title>

<title>The Bttv Driver</title>
<para>
Drivers for Bt8x8-based hardware have been a part of the <ulink url="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux</ulink> 
<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28computer_science%29">kernel</ulink> since version 2.2.0,

<sect3 id="kernel-modules">
<title>Module or In-Kernel?</title>
<para>
It is likely the stock kernel that was installed on your Linux system, if unmodified, already 
supports Bt8x8-based hardware.  The driver will exist either as a 
loadable module or within the already running kernel. An easy way to tell is to use the 
<command>dmesg</command> command piped into <command>less</command> (for easy viewing) 
to look for an acknowledgement that the 
driver in question was loaded when your system started up:</para>

<para>
<screen>
   $ dmesg | less
</screen>
</para>
<para>
...which may yield something like the following, depending on your exact Bt8x8 
chipset features and kernel version (in this case, 2.6):

</para>
<para>
If you don't see it, the particular driver module you are interested in may 
be available but not necessarily loaded at that time. If you know what the module is named, 
try using <filename>find</filename>; in this example we are looking for the 'bttv' module:</para>
<screen>
   $ find /lib/modules -name bttv.o
</screen>
<para>Note that up until the 2.4 series modules had the suffix <filename>.o
</filename>; for 2.6+ series kernels this was replaced with <filename>.ko</filename>.</para>
<para>
You can get a list of all modules available by typing the following at the command line:</para>
<para>
<screen> 
   $ ls -R /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel </screen>
</para>

<para> Where <command>`uname -r`</command>, surrounded by forward tick marks, is your kernel version number.

The following output is an example of what you might find in a Bttv-ready kernel, where everything is 
loaded as a module (edited for brevity):</para>

<para>
<screen>
   /lib/modules/2.6.8/kernel/drivers/media/video:
    btcx-risc.ko    ir-kbd-i2c.ko  tda9875.ko  tvaudio.ko      video-buf.ko
    bttv.ko         msp3400.ko     tda9887.ko  v4l1-compat.ko  videodev.ko
    ir-kbd-gpio.ko  tda7432.ko     tuner.ko    v4l2-common.ko
</screen>
</para>
<para>
Again, your output may vary by the currently running kernel capabilities.
</para>
<para>
Once you know which module your hardware needs you can find out if it is already loaded 
by typing at the command line or in a terminal window:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
   # lsmod
</screen></para>

<para> As shown by the prompt above, you will need to have root privileges
to do this.

You should get output similar to, but not necessarily limited to the following:</para>
<para>
<screen>

   tuner                  18832  0

</screen>
</para>
<para> Most stock kernels are compiled with <filename>kmod</filename>, 
which enables automatic loading of necessary modules when the appropriate 
hardware is detected. It may not always do so, however, so  if you don't 
have the particular module you're seeking loaded and
you think the module may be available, try loading
it manually with <command>modprobe</command>, as in the 
following example (using the <filename>bttv</filename> module):</para>

<para>
<screen>
   # modprobe -v bttv
</screen>
</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>


<sect2 id="recompile">
<title>No Bttv module or in-kernel support found?</title>

<para>If your running kernel or precompiled distribution kernel inexplicably 
doesn't have Bt8x8 support enabled or available, your can always acquire new 
kernel source code from the Linux <ulink url="http://www.kernel.org">
kernel.org</ulink> source code repository. If you are unfamiliar with the 
prerequisites and procedure of compiling your own kernel, I direct you to the <ulink
url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">Kernel HOWTO</ulink>
for more information.  </para>
<para>
If you do recompile, the Bttv driver itself will obviously need to be enabled, 
and is found in the heading entitled "Multimedia Devices" -> "Video for Linux" 
in the 2.4 and earlier kernels in menuconfig or xconfig, or alternatively in 
"Device Drivers" -> "Multimedia Devices" -> "Video for Linux" -> "BT848 Video 
For Linux" in the 2.6+ series. 
</para>
<note><para>You will need <filename>i2c</filename> subsystem support 
enabled as well as <filename>i2c-algo-bit</filename>.</para></note>

<para>Device support (<filename>i2c-dev</filename>) is not required for Bt8x8 
support. Earlier than kernel version 2.3.34 i2c is not present in the kernel 
source and a patch must be fetched and applied to your source, found at the 
<ulink url="http://secure.netroedge.com/~lm78/download.html">lm_sensors homepage</ulink>.
</para>
<para>
If you are running a 2.4 series kernel, <command>btaudio</command> 
in the OSS "Sound" category is optional if you want to use external speakers 
attached to the the card's audio out jack, and either (or both) OSS or 
ALSA sound system btaudio drivers in the 2.6+ series.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="tuning">
<title>Configuration Requirements for Use of your Bttv Hardware</title> 
<para>
Once you know your kernel is enabled you can proceed to some minor tuning that 
may already be done for you depending on your system and distributor and 
distribution features.</para> 

<sect3 id="dev">
<title>Device Files</title>
<para>
If you are using 
<ulink url="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/linux/docs/devfs.html">
Device Filesystem</ulink> (devfs) or 
<ulink url="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev.html">
udev</ulink> your work in this respect may be done for you dynamically, but 
at the same time the devices may not exist until they are recognized by the 
kernel (i.e., the necessary modules loaded), so be sure you have taken care 
of the previously outlined prerequisites first.
</para>
<para>The Linux kernel requires a virtual device node be created to access 
and control a particular piece of hardware. This node may have already been 
created for you automatically; <command>ls -l /dev/video*</command> (with an 
asterisk) or alternatively <command>find /dev -name video*</command> or even 
visual inspection of the <filename>/dev</filename> directory with your 
favorite file manager can give you an idea if the video devices exist. If 
so you can proceed to <xref linkend="permissions">; if not you will need to 
create them manually.</para>

<para>An easy way to create them, if available with your Linux distribution, 
is use of the <filename>MAKEDEV</filename> script, which may be located in 
<filename>/dev</filename> or the usual places for storing executable commands 
(<filename>/bin</filename>,<filename>/sbin</filename> and so on). The manual 
page for <filename>MAKEDEV</filename> (<command>man MAKEDEV</command>) can 
guide you further, but be aware of the device-specific command options. If 
<filename>MAKEDEV</filename> doesn't work or doesn't exist, or you just prefer 
doing things the hard way, move on to the next paragraph.
</para>

<para>
A device can be created as a block (such as a drive), a FIFO
(file-in-file-out or pipe, as in xconsole) or a character device, which
represents other hardware.

Each device has a major and a minor number <quote>coordinate</quote>
to tell the kernel what it is and where to access it.

These numbers are not arbitrary. The major number 81 with minor number 0, 1, 
2, and so on are by convention assigned to Video4linux devices, including TV 
tuner boards and webcams. In order to create the video device 
<filename>/dev/video0</filename>, use <command>mknod</command> at the command 
line:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
   # mknod /dev/video0 c 81 0
</screen>
</para>
<para>
where <command>c</command> represents a character device.</para>

<para>

You can use the following script, which I
have borrowed from the kernel source (located in
<filename>linux/Documentation/video4linux/bttv/MAKEDEV</filename> of
the source tree):</para>

<para>
<screen>
   #!/bin/bash
   function makedev () {
	for dev in 0 1 2 3; do echo "/dev/$1$dev:
	char 81 $[ $2 + $dev ]" rm -f /dev/$1$dev
	mknod /dev/$1$dev c 81 $[ $2 + $dev ] chmod
	666 /dev/$1$dev
   	done

   	# symlink for default device
	rm -f /dev/$1 ln -s /dev/${1}0 /dev/$1
   	}

	# see http://roadrunner.swansea.uk.linux.org/v4lapi.shtml
	echo "*** new device names ***" makedev video
	0 makedev radio 64 makedev vtx 192 makedev vbi 224
	# "*** old device names (for compatibility only) ***"
	#makedev bttv 0 #makedev bttv-fm 64 #makedev bttv-vbi 224
</screen>
</para>

<para> Simply copy and paste the above into your favorite editing program,
save it as MAKEDEV or whatever name you like, make it executable
(i.e., <command>chmod u+x MAKEDEV</command>), and then execute it as root: </para>

<para>

<screen>
   # ./MAKEDEV
</screen>
</para>
</sect3>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="permissions">

<title>Groups and Permissions</title>

<para> It is a good idea to be sure that your user account can access
the device once all modules are loaded and device nodes created.

The most security-conscious way to do that is to add access for a
particular group.

On my system, the members of the group 'video' are allowed to use the
webcam, scanner and other photographic devices.

The way to accomplish this is to first change the ownership of the
devices in <filename>/dev</filename> like so (as root): </para>

<para>
<screen>
   # chown root.video /dev/usb/video*
</screen>
</para>

<para> ...where <command>root.video</command> are the owner and group
the device will now belong to.

Obviously, the specific command will vary by your system and the type
of device.

It is important that you change the ownership of the device node itself
and not the symlink; symlinks' ownerships are affected only by changing
the parent devices or files they point to.  </para>

<para> To see if your user account is a member of the group in question,
as root issue the following command:

<screen>
   # grep -e video /etc/group</screen>

You should see something like the following:</para>

<para>
<screen>
   video:x:44:
</screen>
</para>

<para> ...where '44' is the group number.

Since no members follow the last colon in the 'video' group, we can add
them, let's say user 'jhs' with the command</para>

<para>
<screen>
   # adduser jhs  video
</screen>
</para>

<para> After this, it's simply a matter of allowing read and write access
for the user in question of the device like so: </para>

<para>
<screen>
   # chmod g+rw /dev/v4l/video0
</screen>
</para>

<para> ...where <command>g+rw</command> means add <command>r</command>ead
and <command>w</command>rite access for <command>g</command>roup.

See the documentation for chmod (<command>man chmod</command> or
<command>info chmod</command>) for further info.</para>

<title>The Bttv Module</title>

<para>
Once your card is installed, you can load the bttv module if your kernel 
hasn't already done it for you. Using the 
<command>modprobe</command> command as root, type  

<screen>
   # modprobe bttv</screen>

The modules <filename>videodev</filename> and <filename>i2c</filename> may be 
required prior to this if you are running a pre-2.4 series kernel. By default, 
the <command>bttv</command> will try to autodetect your card type; you can inspect <command>/var/log/messages</command> to see what it finds.  If it doesn't
autodetect properly,
you can add the <command>card=#</command> option to the end of the previous command
to force a your particular card type, a list of which are found in <xref linkend="cards"> 
or on your system in 
<ulink url="file:///usr/src/linux/Documentation/video4linux/bttv/Cards">your 
kernel source Documentation</ulink> if installed in the usual place 
(<filename>/usr/src/linux</filename>. If you get in trouble and need 
to remove the module, you can use <command>rmmod</command>:
<screen>
   $ rmmod bttv</screen>
You can then reload the module with the appropriate options.</para>

<title>The Tuner Module</title>

<para>
If necessary, load the tuner module, with
<screen>
   # modprobe tuner
</screen>
If the tuner is not correctly identified you may need to supply the 
magic number for tuner-type:
<screen>
   # modprobe tuner type=#
</screen>
</para>
<para>
You may need to dig into your case to see which tuner you have if you can't 
find the maker and model in the printed specifications that came with your 
hardware, or if this information is otherwise unavailable. It should be marked 
with the brand name and may support one or more of the three major broadcast 
standards in use in the world, whether 
<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC">NTSC</ulink>, 
<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL">PAL</ulink> or 
<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECAM">SECAM</ulink>. In general, 
chipsets manufactured for the US market are NTSC; for Europe, PAL, and Asia 
PAL or SECAM. Some countries support more than one standard.

<filename>/etc/modules.conf</filename>, depending on your distribution.  Then, 
running an application which needs the driver will cause it to be loaded 
automatically with the appropriate options. The following is an example entry:

<appendix id="options"><title>Optional Arguments for Loading Modules</title>
<literallayout>

<command>videodev.o</command>
-----------------------------
   
   This is the basic video4linux module, all video 
   drivers (incl. bttv) register themselves here.



<command>i2c.o</command>
------------------------
   
   The generic i2c module. It does much of the i2c bus
   management, all other modules (except videodev.o)
   use this one.

   modprobe args:
      <command>scan=1</command>   scan the bus for i2c devices
      <command>verbose=0</command>   shut up i2c
      <command>i2c_debug=1</command>   for debugging, it sticks the 
         whole (software) i2c bus traffic to the syslog

 
<command>bttv.o</command>
-------------------------
   
   The bt848 (grabber chip) driver.

   modprobe args:
      <command>remap=adr</command>  remap Bt848 memory to address less than 20		
      <command>vidmem=base</command>	frame buffer address over 20 (of 
         graphic card)
      <command>triton1=0/1</command>  for Triton1 compatibility; Triton1 is 
         automatically recognized but this might also help with other chipsets
      <command>pll=0/1/2</command>  pll settings (<command>0</command>: don't use PLL; <command>1</command>: 28 MHz crystal installed
         <command>2</command>: 35 MHz crystal installed
      <command>radio=0/1</command>	card supports radio
      <command>card=</command><emphasis>n</emphasis>  card type: see the next section for the complete list;
         remap, card, radio and pll accept up to four comma-separated arguments
	 (for multiple boards).  The CARD and PLL defines from the Makefile
         are used as defaults.

 
 
<command>msp3400.o</command>
----------------------------
   
   The driver for the msp34xx sound processor chips. If you have a
   stereo card, you probably want to modprobe this one.

   modprobe args:
      <command>debug=1/2</command>  print some debug info to the syslog, 2 is more verbose.



<command>*tea6300.o</command>
-----------------------------
   
   The driver for the tea6300 fader chip.  If you have a stereo
   card and the msp3400.o doesn't work, you might want to try this
   one.  This chip is seen on most STB TV/FM cards (usually from
   Gateway OEM sold surplus on auction sites).

   modprobe args:
      <command>debug=1</command>  print some debug info to the syslog.



<command>*tda8425.o</command>
-----------------------------

   The driver for the tda8425 fader chip.  This driver used to be
   part of bttv.c, so if your sound used to work but does not
   anymore, try loading this module.

   modprobe args:
      <command>debug=1</command>  print some debug info to the syslog.



<command>*tda9855.o</command>
-----------------------------

   The driver for the tda9855 stereo decoder / audio processor chip.
	
   modprobe args:
      <command>debug=1</command>  print some debug info to the syslog.



<command>*dpl3518.o</command>
-----------------------------

   Driver for the dpl3518a Dolby Pro Logic Processor.
	
   modprobe args:
      <command>debug=1</command>  print some debug info to the syslog.



<command>tuner.o</command>
--------------------------
   
   The tuner driver.  You need this unless you want to use only
   with a camera or external tuner.
   
   modprobe args:
      <command>debug=1</command>  print some debug info to the syslog
      <command>type=</command><emphasis>n</emphasis> type of the tuner chip. n as seen in <xref linkend="modprobe">



<command>i2c_chardev.o</command>
--------------------------------

   Provides a character device for i2c bus access.  Works for 2.1.x
   only, not compiled by default.

MATRIX Vision
-------------

MV-Delta
- Bt848A
- 4 Composite inputs, 1 S-VHS input (shared with 4th composite)
- EEPROM

http://www.matrix-vision.de/

This card has no tuner but supports all 4 composite (1 shared with an
S-VHS input) of the Bt848A.
Very nice card if you only have satellite TV but several tuners connected
to the card via composite.

Many thanks to Matrix-Vision for giving us 2 cards for free which made
Bt848a/Bt849 single crystal operation support possible!!!



Miro/Pinnacle PCTV
------------------

- Bt848 
  some (all??) come with 2 crystals for PAL/SECAM and NTSC 
- PAL, SECAM or NTSC TV tuner (Philips or TEMIC)
- MSP34xx sound decoder on add on board
  decoder is supported but AFAIK does not yet work 
  (other sound MUX setting in GPIO port needed??? somebody who fixed this???)
- 1 tuner, 1 composite and 1 S-VHS input
- tuner type is autodetected

Many thanks for the free card which made first NTSC support possible back
in 1997!


Hauppauge Win/TV pci
--------------------

There are many different versions of the Hauppauge cards with different 
tuners (TV+Radio ...), teletext decoders.
Note that even cards with same model numbers have (depending on the revision)
different chips on it.

- Bt848 (and others but always in 2 crystal operation???)
  newer cards have a Bt878
- PAL, SECAM, NTSC or tuner with or without Radio support

e.g.:
  PAL: 
  TDA5737: VHF, hyperband and UHF mixer/oscillator for TV and VCR 3-band tuners
  TSA5522: 1.4 GHz I2C-bus controlled synthesizer, I2C 0xc2-0xc3
  
  NTSC:
  TDA5731: VHF, hyperband and UHF mixer/oscillator for TV and VCR 3-band tuners
  TSA5518: no datasheet available on Philips site
- Philips SAA5246 or SAA5284 ( or no) Teletext decoder chip	
  with buffer RAM (e.g. Winbond W24257AS-35: 32Kx8 CMOS static RAM)
  SAA5246 (I2C 0x22) is supported
- 256 bytes EEPROM: Microchip 24LC02B or Philips 8582E2Y 
  with configuration information
  I2C address 0xa0 (24LC02B also responds to 0xa2-0xaf)
- 1 tuner, 1 composite and (depending on model) 1 S-VHS input
- 14052B: mux for selection of sound source
- sound decoder: TDA9800, MSP34xx (stereo cards) 


Askey CPH-Series
----------------
Developed by TelSignal(?), OEMed by many vendors (Typhoon, Anubis, Dynalink)

  Card series:
    CPH01x: BT848 capture only
    CPH03x: BT848
    CPH05x: BT878 with FM
    CPH06x: BT878 (w/o FM)f/
    CPH07x: BT878 capture only
 
  TV standards:
     CPH0x0: NTSC-M/M
     CPH0x1: PAL-B/G
     CPH0x2: PAL-I/I
     CPH0x3: PAL-D/K
     CPH0x4: SECAM-L/L 
     CPH0x5: SECAM-B/G 
     CPH0x6: SECAM-D/K 
     CPH0x7: PAL-N/N 
     CPH0x8: PAL-B/H 
     CPH0x9: PAL-M/M

  CPH03x was often sold as "TV capturer".

  Identifying:
  1) 878 cards can be identified by PCI Subsystem-ID:
      144f:3000 = CPH06x
      144F:3002 = CPH05x w/ FM
      144F:3005 = CPH06x_LC (w/o remote control)
  1) The cards have a sticker with "CPH"-model on the back.
  2) These cards have a number printed on the PCB just above the tuner metal box:
      "80-CP2000300-x" = CPH03X
      "80-CP2000500-x" = CPH05X
      "80-CP2000600-x" = CPH06X / CPH06x_LC

  Askey sells these cards as "Magic TView series", Brand "MagicXpress".
  Other OEM often call these "Tview", "TView99" or else.

Lifeview Flyvideo Series:
-------------------------
  The naming of these series differs in time and space.

  Identifying:
  1) Some models can be identified by PCI subsystem ID:
      1852:1852 = Flyvideo 98 FM
      1851:1850 = Flyvideo 98
      1851:1851 = Flyvideo 98 EZ (capture only)
  2) There is a print on the PCB:
      LR25       = Flyvideo (Zoran ZR36120, SAA7110A)
      LR26 Rev.N = Flyvideo II (Bt848)
           Rev.O = Flyvideo II (Bt878)
      LR37 Rev.C = Flyvideo EZ (Capture only, ZR36120 + SAA7110)
      LR38 Rev.A1= Flyvideo II EZ (Bt848 capture only)
      LR50 Rev.Q = Flyvideo 98 (w/eeprom and PCI subsystem ID)
           Rev.W = Flyvideo 98 (no eeprom)
      LR51 Rev.E = Flyvideo 98 EZ (capture only)
      LR90       = Flyvideo 2000 (Bt878)
		   Flyvideo 2000S (Bt878) w/Stereo TV (Package incl. LR91 daughterboard)
      LR91       = Stereo daughter card for LR90
      LR97       = Flyvideo DVBS
      LR99 Rev.E = Low profile card for OEM integration (only internal audio!) bt878
      LR136	 = Flyvideo 2100/3100 (Low profile, SAA7130/SAA7134)
      LR137      = Flyvideo DV2000/DV3000 (SAA7130/SAA7134 + IEEE1394)
      LR138 Rev.C= Flyvideo 2000 (SAA7130)
	        or Flyvideo 3000 (SAA7134) w/Stereo TV
		   These exist in variations w/FM and w/Remote sometimes denoted
		   by suffixes "FM" and "R".

      Lifeview.com.tw states (Feb. 2002):
      "The FlyVideo2000 and FlyVideo2000s product name have renamed to FlyVideo98."
      Their Bt8x8 cards are listed as discontinued.
      Flyvideo 2000S was probably sold as Flyvideo 3000 in some countries(Europe?).
      The new Flyvideo 2000/3000 are SAA7130/SAA7134 based. 

  "Flyvideo II" had been the name for the 848 cards, nowadays (in Germany)
  this name is re-used for LR50 Rev.W.
  The Lifeview website mentioned Flyvideo III at some time, but such a card
  has not yet been seen (perhaps it was the German name for LR90 [stereo]).
  These cards are sold by many OEMs too.

  FlyVideo A2 (Elta 8680)= LR90 Rev.F (w/Remote, w/o FM, stereo TV by tda9821) {Germany}
  Lifeview 3000 (Elta 8681) as sold by Plus(April 2002), Germany = LR138 w/ saa7134

<appendix id="recording"><title>Recording Video and Sound with Bttv</title>
<para>
In addition to the applications referenced in <xref linkend="apps">, recording 
can be managed from the command line. The issues discussed here with regard 
to sound capture deal only with the default kernel-2.6 and higher sound system:
the <ulink url="http://www.alsa-project.org/">Advanced Linux Sound Architecture</ulink>.</para>
<para>
The easy part is grabbing the video, for which we will use <command>streamer</command>, 
available with the <ulink url="http://linux.bytesex.org/xawtv/">Xawtv suite</ulink>. 
Sound is another matter, however. You will need to access your mixer settings 
using <command>amixer</command>, the ALSA command-line mixer that should be 
available in the ALSA-tools package available from your Linux distributor. 
See <command>man amixer</command> to follow the command line options. 
</para>
<para>
Your recording can be managed either using your primary soundcard if you have 
your Bt8x8 audio output connected to a mixer conduit that allows for capture 
(e.g. the 4-pin analog CDROM input slot), or the Bt8x8 card itself using the 
<command>btaudio</command> module. The following steps utilize the latter. 
First, identify the individual cards on your system (requires <filename>/proc</filename> filesystem):
<screen>
   $ cat /proc/asound/pcm
   00-00: Intel ICH : NVidia CK8S : playback 1 : capture 1
   00-01: Intel ICH - MIC ADC : NVidia CK8S - MIC ADC : capture 1
   00-02: Intel ICH - IEC958 : NVidia CK8S - IEC958 : playback 1
   01-00: Bt87x Digital : Bt87x Digital : capture 1
   01-01: Bt87x Analog : Bt87x Analog : capture 1
</screen>
The first column indicates the system numbering of your available sound devices, i.e., 
card 0 is the soundcard and card 01, or 1, is the Bt8x8.
</para>
<para>
Next, identify the mixer controls for the Bt8x8 card.
<screen>
   $ amixer -c 1 controls
   numid=3,iface=MIXER,name='Capture Source'
   numid=2,iface=MIXER,name='Capture Boost'
   numid=1,iface=MIXER,name='Capture Volume'
</screen>
Then identify the item settings of each:
<screen>
   $ amixer -c 1 cget name='Capture Source'
   numid=3,iface=MIXER,name='Capture Source'
   ; type=ENUMERATED,access=rw---,values=1,items=3
   ; Item #0 'TV Tuner'
   ; Item #1 'FM'
   ; Item #2 'Mic/Line'
   : values=1

   $ amixer -c 1 cget name='Capture Boost'
   numid=2,iface=MIXER,name='Capture Boost'
   ; type=BOOLEAN,access=rw---,values=1
   values=on

   $ amixer -c 1 cget name='Capture Volume'
   numid=1,iface=MIXER,name='Capture Volume'
   ; type=INTEGER,access=rw---,values=1,min=0,max=15,step=0
   : values=0
</screen>    
Use <command>cset</command> for the capture source:
<screen>
   $ amixer -c 1 cset name='Capture Source' 0
</screen>
...and to set the volume:
<screen>
   $ amixer -c 1 cset name="Capture Volume' 15
</screen>
...and you should be ready.</para>
<para>
Now try to record something:
<screen>
   $ streamer -p 4 -t 1:00 -r 24 -q -o test.avi -j 90 -f mjpeg -F mono16
</screen>
...and you should be recording a sound-enabled avi file. Press [Ctrl]-C to 
cancel early. Next step is to automate the recording for your very own 
home-brewed <trademark>Tivo</trademark>!
</para>
<para>
I offer the following script as an example program for automating recording; 
you can copy and paste it into a file and make it executable (<command>chmod 
u+x record-tv.sh</command>).</para> <warning><para>This script (and any
recording from your Bttv device for that matter) generates extremely large 
files, on the order of several GB per hour, so be sure you have lots of free 
disk space available.</para></warning>

<para>
FM radio tuners are easily enabled when inserting modules. Simply
<screen>
   $ modprobe bttv radio=1
</screen>
...or add a similar option to your <filename>/etc/modules.conf</filename> 
and you should be set the next time you restart or load the module. You will 
also need an application to access the radio. I suggest the 
console based <command>radio</command>, available with the 
<ulink url="http://linux.bytesex.org/xawtv/">Xawtv suite</ulink>, or 
<ulink url="http://www.stanford.edu/~blp/fmtools/">fmtools</ulink>.

	software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
	of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
	We recommend this License principally for works in which its
	purpose is instruction or reference.
</para>

<para> 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS </para>

<para>
	This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
	that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
	it can be distributed under the terms of this License.	Such a
	notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in
	duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein.
	The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.
	Any member of the public is a licensee and is addressed as "you".
	You accept the license if you copy, modify, or distribute the
	work in a way, thus requiring permission under copyright law.
</para>

<para>
	A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing
	the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
	modifications and/or translated into another language.
</para>

<para>
	A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
	section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
	relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
	Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
	nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
	(Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,
	a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)  The
	relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
	the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
	philosophical, ethical, or political position regarding them.
</para>

<para>
	The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections in which
	titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
	in the notice that says that the Document is released under
	this License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
	Secondary, then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
	The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
	does not identify any Invariant Sections, then there are none.
</para>

<para>
	The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
	listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
	that says that the Document is released under this License.
	A Front-Cover Text may be at most five words, and a Back-Cover
	Text may be at most 25 words.
</para>

<para>
	A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
	copy, represented in a format where its specification is available
	to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document
	straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
	composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
	widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input
	to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
	formats suitable for input to text formatters.	A copy made in an
	otherwise Transparent file format in which its markup, or absence
	of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
	modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format
	is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.
	A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
</para>

<para>
	Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
	plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX
	input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
	standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
	human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
	PNG, XCF, and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats
	that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
	SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not
	generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript
	or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.
</para>

<para>
	The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
	plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
	material this License requires to appear in the title page.
	For works in formats, which do not have any title page as such,
	"Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
	the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</para>

<para>
	A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
	in which its title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ
	in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another
	language.  (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned
	below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements",
	or "History".)	To "Preserve the Title" of such a section,
	when you modify the Document, means that it remains a section
	"Entitled XYZ", according to this definition.
</para>

<para>
	The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
	which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
	Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference
	in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties:
	any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have
	is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
</para>

<para> 2. VERBATIM COPYING </para>

<para>
	You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
	commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
	copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
	applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that
	you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.
	You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
	reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
	However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.
	If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also
	follow the conditions in section 3.
</para>

<para>
	You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
	and you may publicly display copies.
</para>

<para> 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY </para>

<para>
	If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
	have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,
	and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
	enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
	all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover,
	and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also
	clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.
	The front cover must present the full title with all words of the
	title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
	on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
	covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
	satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
	other respects.
</para>

<para>
	If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
	fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as
	fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
	adjacent pages.
</para>

<para>
	If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the
	Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a
	machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy,
	or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location
	from which the general network-using public has access to download
	using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
	copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
	latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when
	you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
	that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
	stated location until at least one year after the last time you
	distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
	retailers) of that edition to the public.
</para>

<para>
	It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors
	of the Document well before redistributing any large number of
	copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
	version of the Document.
</para>

<para> 4. MODIFICATIONS </para>

<para>
	You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
	under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that
	you release the Modified Version under precisely this License,
	with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document,
	thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified
	Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you
	must do these things in the Modified Version:
</para>

<para>
	A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
	distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
	versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
	History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
	as a previous version if the original publisher of that version
	gives permission.
</para>

<para>
	B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
	entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
	Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
	authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
	fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.
</para>

<para>
	C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
	Modified Version, as the publisher.
</para>

<para>
	D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
</para>

<para>
	E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
	adjacent to the other copyright notices.
</para>

<para>
	F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
	notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
	under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the
	Addendum below.
</para>

<para>
	G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
	Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
	license notice.
</para>

<para>
	H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
</para>

<para>
	I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
	and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
	authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
	the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History"
	in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
	and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then
	add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
	previous sentence.
</para>

<para>
	J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
	for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document and
	likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
	versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History"
	section.  You may omit a network location for a work that was
	published at least four years before the Document itself, or
	if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives
	permission.
</para>

<para>
	K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
	Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
	the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
	and/or dedications given therein.
</para>

<para>
	L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
	in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
	equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
</para>

<para>
	M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".	Such a section
	may not be included in the Modified Version.
</para>

<para>
	N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
	"Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
</para>

<para>
	O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.  If the Modified Version
	includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify
	as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
	Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these
	sections as invariant.	To do this, add their titles to the list
	of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
	These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
	You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it
	contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
	various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
	the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
	definition of a standard.
</para>

<para>
	You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
	Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text,
	to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.
	Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text
	may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.
	If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
	previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
	entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another;
	but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from
	the previous publisher that added the old one.
</para>

<para>
	The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
	License give permission to use their names for publicity for or
	to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</para>

<para> 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS </para>

<para>
	You may combine the Document with other documents released under
	this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
	modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
	all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
	unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
	combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
	their Warranty Disclaimers.
</para>

<para>
	The combined work need only contain one copy of this License,
	and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with
	a single copy.	If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
	the same name but different contents, make the title of each
	such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses,
	the name of the original author or publisher of that section if
	known, or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the
	section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license
	notice of the combined work.
</para>

<para>
	In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
	"History" in the various original documents, forming one section
	Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
	"Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".
	You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".
</para>

<para> 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS </para>

<para>
	You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
	documents released under this License, and replace the individual
	copies of this License in the various documents with a single
	copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow
	the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
	documents in all other respects.
</para>

<para>
	You may extract a single document from such a collection and
	distribute it individually under this License, provided you
	insert a copy of this License into the extracted document and
	follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
	copying of that document.
</para>

<para> 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS </para>

<para>
	A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
	separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
	a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
	copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
	legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
	works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate,
	this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate
	which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
</para>

<para>
	If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
	copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
	half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
	placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate,
	or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in
	electronic form.  Otherwise, they must appear on printed covers
	that bracket the whole aggregate.
</para>

<para> 8. TRANSLATION </para>

<para>
	Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
	distribute translations of the Document under the terms of
	section 4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations
	requires special permission from their copyright holders, but
	you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections
	in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
	You may include a translation of this License, and all the license
	notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided
	that you also include the original English version of this License
	and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers.
	In case of a disagreement between the translation and the
	original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer,
	the original version will prevail.
</para>

<para>
	If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
	"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
	Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing
	the actual title.
</para>

<para> 9. TERMINATION </para>

<para>
	You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
	except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
	attempt to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
	is void and will automatically terminate your rights under
	this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
	rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
	terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
</para>

<para> 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE </para>

<para>
	The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
	the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
	versions will be similar in spirit to the present version
	but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
	See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
</para>

<para>
	Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
	number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
	version of this License "or any later version" applies to it,
	you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
	of that specified version or of any later version that has
	been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
	If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
	you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)
	by the Free Software Foundation.
</para>

<para> ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents </para>

<para>
	To use this License in a document you have written, include
	a copy of the License in the document and put the following
	copyright and license notices just after the title page:
</para>

<para>
	Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.  Permission is granted to copy,
	distribute, and/or modify this document under the terms of the
	GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version
	published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant
	Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.  A copy
	of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free
	Documentation License".
</para>

<para>
	If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
	Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this: with the
	Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover
	Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
	If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
	combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit
	the situation.
</para>

<para>
	If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code,
	we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
	choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
	License, to permit their use in free software.
</para>
