			<title>What This Document Is:</title>
			<para>This document started out as a way for me to document the procedure and
				required readings for re-creating the deployment of Qmail-Scanner and ClamAV
				for my employer&apos;s email system. I am not a writer, or a programmer. I am
				a lowly little systems administrator that got frustrated looking online for
				all of the information to make Qmail-Scanner work with ClamAV. This HOWTO
				will document the steps that I took to get Qmail-Scanner and ClamAV to work
				together. Is this the right way to do it? Who knows, it worked for me. There
				are plenty of snippets of information that I <emphasis>&quot;liberated&quot;</emphasis> from many sources.
				Please see the Acknowledgments. The most current version of this document can

			<title>What This Document Is Not:</title>
			<para>This document is not a comprehensive source of information for ClamAV,
				Qmail-Scanner, qmail, daemontools, Linux, Un*x, FreeBSD, Perl, etc. I do not
				pretend to know everything about everything. Like I said before, this worked
				for me it may not work for you. If you don&apos;t know how to use a particular OS,
				tool, or piece of software, THIS HOWTO WILL NOT HELP YOU! I am a firm
				believer in RTFM. So please make sure that you check out Appendix A, and the
				Disclaimer before following this HOWTO.</para>

			<title>What is ClamAV?</title>
			<para>From the ClamAV website:</para>
			<para>&quot;Clam AntiVirus is a <ulink url="http://www.opensource.org">
               <citetitle>GPL</citetitle></ulink> anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose
				of this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment scanning).
				The package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a command
				line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via Internet. The programs
				are based on a shared library distributed with the Clam AntiVirus package,
				which you can use with your own software. Most importantly, the virus
				database is <emphasis>kept up to date</emphasis>.&quot;</para>
		</sect1>
		<sect1>
			<title>Installing ClamAV</title>
			<para>Download the ClamAV source at <ulink url="http://www.clamav.net">
               <citetitle>http://www.clamav.net</citetitle></ulink>. As of the writing
				of this HOWTO, the latest version is 0.65.</para>
			<screen>
#tar -xvzf clamav-0.65.tar.gz 
#cd clamav-0.65 #groupadd clamav
#useradd clamav -g clamav -c "Clam AntiVirus" -s /nonexistent .
#/configure
#make 
#make install 
#cd ..
			</screen>
		</sect1>
		<sect1>
			<title>Testing</title>
			<para>As long as make and make install have finished without errors, you are
				now ready to test your installation (If you did experience errors, please
				review the ClamAV documentation that was included in the tar ball. You may
				also try the ClamAV website for some helpful tips). To test your installation
				type:</para>
			<screen>#clamscan -r -l scan.txt clamav-0.65</screen>
			<para>Clamscan should find a test virus (This is NOT a real virus) in the
				clamav-0.65/test directory and log it to the scan.txt log file.</para>
			<para>Now you need to configure the ClamAV daemon, clamd, for testing.</para>
			<screen>#vi /usr/local/etc/clamav.conf</screen>
			<para>Comment out "Example" line in clamav.conf and save.</para>
			<screen>#clamdscan -l scan.txt clamav-0.65</screen>
			<para>This should provide output that is similar to the clamscan command you
				entered above.</para>
		</sect1>
		<sect1>
			<title>Updating Defs</title>
			<para>Now we need to update our virus definitions. Clamscan includes a
				utility, freshclam, to take care of this. Freshclam automatically changes
				from root to the clamav user that you created during the installation. First,
				create a log file that freshclam can log to.</para>
			<screen>
#touch /var/log/clam-update.log
#chmod 600 /var/log/clamupdate.log
#chown clamav /var/log/clamupdate.log</screen>
			<para>Now start freshclam:</para>
			<screen>
#freshclam -d -c 6 -l /var/log/clam-update.log
			</screen>
			<para>This checks for a new virus definition database six (6) times a day.
				Check the /var/log/clam-update.log file. It should look something like this:</para>
			<screen>

			<title>What Is Qmail-Scanner?</title>
			<para>From the Qmail-Scanner website: &quot;Qmail-Scanner is an addon that
				enables a qmail email server to scan all gateway-ed email for certain
				characteristics (i.e. a content scanner). It is typically used for its
				anti-virus protection functions, in which case it is used in conjunction with
				commercial virus scanners, but also enables a site (at a server/site level)
				to react to email that contains specific strings in particular headers, or
				particular attachment filenames or types (e.g. *.VBS attachments). It also
				can be used as an archiving tool for auditing or backup purposes.
				Qmail-Scanner is integrated into the mail server at a lower level than some
				other Unix-based virus scanners, resulting in better performance. It is
				capable of scanning not only locally sent/received email, but also email that
				crosses the server in a relay capacity.&quot;</para>

This script will search your system for the virus scanners it knows
about, and will ensure that all external programs
qmail-scanner-queue.pl uses are explicitly pathed for performance
reasons.

It will then generate qmail-scanner-queue.pl - it is up to you to install it
correctly.

			<title>Ownership</title>
			<para>In order for Qmail-Scanner to be able to use ClamAV, some of the ClamAV
				ownerships must be changed. If you recall, we made a clamav user to run
				ClamAV, and then changed the permissions so only the clamav user could run
				it. Now we need to provide the qscand user privledges to use ClamAV First,
				change the ownership of the clamd supervise directories.</para>
			<screen>#chown -R qscand /usr/local/clamav/supervise</screen>

		<title>Configuring qmail to Use qmail-scanner-queue.pl</title>
		<sect1>
			<title>Changing Your Tcp Rules</title>
			<para>Once everything is installed, configured, and successfully tested,
				configure qmail to utilize Qmail-Scanner and ClamAV. If you have followed the
				instructions found in Dave Sills Life With qmail (see Appendix A: Reading
				Resources), you should have a tcp.smtp file in your /etc directory. You must
				edit tcp.smtp file to include the QMAILQUEUE variable.</para>
			<screen>	
#vi /etc/tcp.smtp

127.:allow,RELAYCLIENT=&quot;&quot;,QMAILQUEUE=&quot;/var/qmail/bin/qmail-queue&quot;
10.:allow,RELAYCLIENT=&quot;&quot;,QMAILQUEUE=&quot;/var/qmail/bin/qmail-scanner-queue.pl&quot;
:allow.QMAILQUEUE=&quot;/var/qmail/bin/qmail-scanner-queue.pl&quot;
			</screen>
			<para>As you can see, we use qmail-queue for all local deliveries by setting
				the QMAILQUEUE variable to be the original qmail-queue. We then changed the
				local subnet mail deliveries to use qmail-scanner-queue.pl. This causes all
				local subnet SMTP traffic to be scanned by Qmail-Scanner and ClamAV. The last
				line of this file scans all inbound emails.</para>
			<para>After adding the QMAILQUEUE variables, you must rebuild the cdb file for
				Qmail.</para>
			<screen>#qmailctl cdb</screen>
		</sect1>
		<sect1>
			<title>Increasing Your Softlimit</title>
			<para>If you try to send an email message, you will most likely receive an
				error from your client. The error message will say something that includes
				this:</para>
			<screen>451 qq temporary problem (#4.3.0)</screen>
			<para>If you followed Life with qmail, you then have a memory limit set in the
				/var/qmail/supervise/qmail-smtpd/run file. Look for the line that contains
				softlimit. It should look similar to this:</para>
			<screen>exec /usr/local/bin/softlimit -m 2000000 \</screen>
			<para>This example sets the memory limit for qmail-smtpd to 2M. After all of
				your changes qmail-smtpd is now running the entire Perl interpreter, and
				ClamAV. 2M will never be enough.</para>
			<para>Each system is different, and has different requirements. It will take
				some experimenting on your part to find the correct value for your system&apos;s
				softlimit. Do not set softlimit to some high value! You are asking for
				trouble if you do this. To find the minimal value for your system, I
				recommend the following steps:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>Increase softlimit by 1M</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>#qmailctl restart</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Send a message</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Repeat until you can successfully send an email</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>Once you have found the minimum, I recommend increasing that by 1.5M,
				just for times that your email server has a heavy load.</para>
			<para>After that just create a daily cronjob that runs
				/var/qmail/bin/qmail-scan-queue.pl -z to cleanup any dropped SMTP sessions
				that may be lying around in /var/spool/qmailscan.</para>
		</sect1>
	</chapter>
	<chapter>
		<title>Conclusion</title>
		<para>After following the instructions in this HOWTO, now you can feel
			confident about your email messages being more secure. By implementing
			Qmail-Scanner and clamav, you have successfully added another layer of
			security to your email system and overall anti-virus protection. Of course,
			there is no such thing as 100% secure email messages. Nor will this
			installation replace sound anti-virus practices, but it should make those
			practices a little easier to implement and manage.</para>

			<para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
				functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
				everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
				modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this
				License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their
				work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by
				others.</para>
			<para>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works
				of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the
				GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
				software.</para>
			<para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
				software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
				should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does.
				But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any
				textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
				printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose
				is instruction or reference.</para>

		<section id="gfdl-1">
			<title>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>
			<para id="gfdl-doc">This License applies to any manual or other work, in any
				medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
				be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
				world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
				under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such
				manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as
				"you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
				way requiring permission under copyright law.</para>
			<para id="gfdl-mod-ver">A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
				containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
				modifications and/or translated into another language.</para>
			<para id="gfdl-secnd-sect">A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a
				front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
				relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's
				overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
				directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a
				textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
				mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection
				with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
				philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.</para>
			<para id="gfdl-inv-sect">The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary
				Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
				in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If
				a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
				allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
				Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections
				then there are none.</para>
			<para id="gfdl-cov-text">The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text
				that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
				says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
				be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</para>
			<para id="gfdl-transparent">A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
				machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is
				available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document
				straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
				pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
				drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
				automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
				formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup,
				or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
				modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not
				Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not
				"Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>
			<para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
				without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
				publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or
				PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats
				include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can
				be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
				the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
				machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors
				for output purposes only.</para>
			<para id="gfdl-title-page">The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the
				title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
				the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
				formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
				near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
				beginning of the body of the text.</para>
			<para id="gfdl-entitled">A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the
				Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
				following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for
				a specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
				"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such
				a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section
				"Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.</para>
			<para>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
				states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers
				are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as

				Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this
				License.</para>

			<title>VERBATIM COPYING</title>
			<para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
				commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
				notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document
				are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever
				to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or

			<title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>
			<para>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
				printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's
				license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers
				that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on
				the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must
				also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The
				front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
				prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
				Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the
				title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as
				verbatim copying in other respects.</para>
			<para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
				legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on
				the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</para>
			<para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
				more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
				along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
				computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
				access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
				Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
				latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
				distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
				copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
				year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through
				your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.</para>
			<para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
				Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them
				a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</para>

			<title>MODIFICATIONS</title>
			<para>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
				conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
				Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
				role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
				Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
				these things in the Modified Version:</para>
			<orderedlist id="gfdl-modif-cond" numeration="upperalpha">
				<title>GNU FDL Modification Conditions</title>

						previous sentence.</simpara>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<simpara>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
						public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the

						gives permission.</simpara>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<simpara>For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",

				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			<para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
				that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
				Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
				invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
				the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any
				other section titles.</para>
			<para>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
				nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for
				example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
				organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</para>
			<para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
				passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
				Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and
				one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any
				one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
				previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are
				acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
				one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old
				one.</para>
			<para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
				give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
				endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>
		</section>
		<section id="gfdl-5">
			<title>COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>
			<para>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this 
				License, under the terms defined in <link linkend="gfdl-4">section
				4</link> above for modified versions, provided that you include in the
				combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original
				documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
				combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their
				Warranty Disclaimers.</para>
			<para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
				multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If
				there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different
				contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of
				it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that
				section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the
				section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
				combined work.</para>
			<para>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in
				the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History";
				likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections
				Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".</para>
		</section>
		<section id="gfdl-6">
			<title>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>
			<para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
				released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
				License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the
				collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
				copying of each of the documents in all other respects.</para>
			<para>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
				it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
				License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other
				respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.</para>
		</section>
		<section id="gfdl-7">
			<title>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>
			<para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
				independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
				distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from
				the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's
				users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included
				in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
				aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.</para>
			<para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
				of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
				aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket
				the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if
				the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed
				covers that bracket the whole aggregate.</para>
		</section>
		<section id="gfdl-8">
			<title>TRANSLATION</title>
			<para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
				translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
				Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their
				copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant
				Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
				You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in
				the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
				the original English version of this License and the original versions of
				those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
				translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
				disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</para>
			<para>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
				"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
				Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.</para>
		</section>
		<section id="gfdl-9">
			<title>TERMINATION</title>
			<para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
				as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy,
				modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically
				terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
				copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
				terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</para>
		</section>
		<section id="gfdl-10">
			<title>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>
			<para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
				GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
				similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
				new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</para>
			<para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
				the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or
				any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms
				and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that
				has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
				Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
				any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</para>
		</section>
		<section id="gfdl-addendum">
			<title>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</title>
			<para>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
				the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
				notices just after the title page:</para>
			<blockquote id="copyright-sample">
				<title>Sample Invariant Sections list</title>
				<para>Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute
					and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation
					License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software
					Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no
					Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled
					"GNU Free Documentation License".</para>
			</blockquote>
			<para>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
				replace the "with...Texts." line with this:</para>
			<blockquote id="inv-cover-sample">
				<title>Sample Invariant Sections list</title>
				<para>with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
					Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.</para>
			</blockquote>
			<para>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
				combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.</para>
			<para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
				recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
				software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use
				in free software.</para>
