<abstract><para>

Troubleshooting a Linux-related issue is often perceived as a difficult 
task. But, often, the solution is just a few clicks away on the 
internet. This document will direct Linux users to resources available 
on the Internet that provide access to a vast amount of Linux-related 
information useful in the troubleshooting problems.

</para></abstract>

</articleinfo>

<section id="intro">

<title>Introduction</title>

<para>

The traditional means of troubleshooting computer-related problems 
involves consulting user's manuals, books, friends - probably enticed 
with goodies - and, when all the former do not yield a solution, calling 
the technical support service of the vendor of the product in question. 
And, we all know pleasant and reliably efficacious the latter stratagem 
is. Unfortunately, this is the norm in the sphere of commercial 
proprietary products.

</para>

<para>

In contradistinction, Linux, and related distributions, utilities and 
applications software, have largely been developed according to the 
<ulink url="http://www.opensource.org" >Open Source</ulink> model, 
wherein developers have used electronic communication over the Internet 
- typically in the form of publicly-accessible Mailing Lists - to 
collaborate with their peers in the refinement of the associated source 
code. Such collaboration has also traditionally involved the online 
publication of user's manuals, lists of Frequently-Asked-Questions 
(FAQ's), knowledge bases, release notes, formal guides such as this 
document (HOWTO's) and tutorials. In addition, users often assist others 
through the forum of Usenet and other newsgroups and the posted messages 
are readily accessible in the form of searchable archives. These 
Linux-related newsgroups are renowned for their high level of user 
participation. In significant measure, Linux may be considered a product 
of the Internet.

</para>

<para>

Considered together, these resources enable access to a large, 
ever-expanding factual database, and my intent is to encourage and 
direct the reader to utilize these repositories when faced with an issue 
not addressed in the documentation that is included with each 
distribution of Linux. Linux veterans who assist newcomers through the 
forum of Usenet soon become aware of the frequency with which certain 
technical questions are repeatedly posted - questions the answers to 
which are readily available in one or more of the existent online 
repositories. So, to diminish the likelihood of being "flamed" in 
response to your posted question on Usenet or irc, read further!

</para>

<para>

Armed with a browser, Linux users may rapidly become adept at 
troubleshooting their systems. The key is knowing how and where to look. 
My objective is to guide the user - particularly the Linux newbie - in 
this quest.

Document history

</title>

<para>

Howard Mann conceived and formulated the first version of this HOWTO. He 
kept managing and updating it until version 1.3. Maintainership was then 
taken over by Jean-Philippe Guérard, who is now in charge of this 
document.

</para>
</section>

</section>

<section id="faqs">

<title>Frequently-Asked-Questions (FAQs)</title>

<para>

Users of Internet Newsgroups and Mailing lists soon discovered that some 
basic questions were being asked over and over again. To provide an 
answer to these questions, and to avoid them being repeated continually, 
FAQs were developed, listing the most classical questions and their 
agreed answers.

</para>

<para>

A list of FAQs is also a traditional accompaniment to Linux-related 
software. The FAQ is the first document to peruse when troubleshooting a 
particular application. It provides answers to typical questions, and is 
a good place to start troubleshooting a specific problem. In addition, 
FAQs exist for Linux distributions, window managers, and the so-called 
desktop environments (KDE and Gnome).

</para>

<para>

A FAQ is typically provided online by the developers of the product in 
question, and enterprising users sometimes host an 
<quote>unofficial</quote> FAQ as well. Search for the latter with an 
Internet search engine.

</para>

<para>

For Linux newbies, I provide links to two FAQs that collectively
address <emphasis>many</emphasis> of the questions posted to the Usenet
newsgroups:

</itemizedlist>

</section>

<section id="onlinesupport">

<title>Online Support Sections</title>

<para>

These sections are typically found at the websites of Linux 
distributions, and often contain a variety of helpful documents with 
information not easily encompassed within a FAQ. This is the second 
place to go when troubleshooting a problem. Look for sections with one 
or more of the following titles:

</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>
Installation Support
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>

</itemizedlist>

<para>

Some websites provide a site search engine that will facilitate your 
quest for a solution.

</para>

<para>

If you have a problem with a newly installed distribution, look here 
first as bugs and their fixes are typically posted here. You may find a 
detailed guide that will help you accomplish a task such as upgrading 
your kernel or the version of the X Window System you are using.

</para>

<para>

I have often been able to solve problems with my Linux distribution by 
looking into the bug report database, and finding that another user 
already has offered a solution to this issue.

</para>

<para>

I recommend you spend some time at the website of the distribution you 
are using, familiarizing yourself with what is available.

</para>

</section>

<section id="searchengines">

<title>Internet Search Engines</title>

<para>

I frequently use a Search Engine to retrieve helpful or necessary 
information from the 'net. These engines catalogue pages from 
commercial, personal and academic websites, as well as Mailing Lists and 
the like.

</para>

<para>

There are several good search engine. It is worthwhile becoming very 
familiar with the operational details of at least one non-directory 
engine to maximize the efficiency and efficacy of your search efforts. 
You probably already have a favorite - I like 
<emphasis>Google.com</emphasis>, and will discuss it in a little more 
detail.

</para>

<para>

The key to a successful search is to use a good set of keywords. If 
you're getting a specific error message, you might search for its text. 
Otherwise, you need to find a few relevant words describing your 
problem. Then, by trial and error, you should be able to find some 
pertinent information.

</para>

<section id="google">

<title>Google.com</title>

<para>

This <ulink url="http://www.google.com">engine</ulink> has several novel 
features that are described in its <ulink 
url="http://www.google.com/technology/">Google Technology page</ulink>. 
In particular, the engine often returns the most useful pages first; in 
fact, I have often found that the first listed page contains the 
information I need. Because it caches web pages, it is relatively fast 
at displaying requested items. It has a so-called 
<trademark>GoogleScout</trademark> feature, activated by clicking on the 
"similar pages" links, that provides additional relevant links with each 
item returned.

</para>

</section>

</section>

<section id="usenet">

<title>Usenet Newsgroup Archives</title>

<para>

The ability to search for and retrieve information from archived posts 
to the Linux-related (Usenet) newsgroups represents a powerful means of 
troubleshooting in Linux.

</para>

<para>

Search engines permit one to search the archives by stipulating the 
forum, keywords, authors, dates, language and combinations thereof. 
Because the number of Linux-related newsgroups is large, the likelihood 
of finding useful information is high.

</para>

<para>

The main web site that currently provides access to Usenet archives 
using a search engine is <ulink url="http://groups.google.com"/>. The 
most effective way to do a search is to use its <ulink 
url="http://groups.google.com/advanced_group_search">Advanced Groups 
Search page</ulink>.

</para>

<para>

I would like to relate a brief anecdote to demonstrate the efficacy of 
this approach. The first time I attempted to build a kernel, I was 
presented with this error message when I invoked a <quote>make</quote> 
command:

</para>

<screen>
make[1]: as86: Command not found
make[1]: *** [bootsect.o] Error 127
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot'
make: *** [zImage]
Error 2
</screen>

<para>

I had no idea what <literal>as86</literal> was, but I entered it as the 
keyword in the <emphasis>Subject</emphasis> field of the Advanced Groups 
Search page at groups.google.com, and was presented with a large number 
of posts from folks who had encountered the same problem. Respondents 
had provided the reason and solution: I did not have an assembler/linker 
necessary to create machine code, and the <medialabel>bin86</medialabel> 
package provided it. I downloaded and installed a RPM package of the 
latter and was on my way. This entire process took about 10 minutes!

</para>

</section>

<section id="mailinglists">

<title>Mailing List Archives</title>

<para>

As you might expect, there are a very large number of Linux-related 
Mailing Lists that enable developers and users to communicate and 
collaborate on projects. These Lists cover every conceivable aspect of 
Linux, from the technical arcana of kernel development to the relatively 
unfocused discussion of issues at the newbie level. Subscribers to a 
particular Mailing List are generally very knowledgeable in the List's 
topic, and detailed and useful information is often retrievable. The 
communications are publicly accessible through Internet search engines 
and in the form of online Mailing List Archives. You will typically see 
archived pages when you conduct a search using an Internet search 
engine.

</para>

<para>

Usually, you will not need to look directly in a Mailing List Archive. 
<link linkend="searchengines">Search engines</link> like Google.com 
include these archives in their databases. If you can't find anything 
with a search engine, it might be worthwhile to browse or search in an 
appropriate Mailing List.

</para>

<para>

Also, not all Mailing Lists are associated with an online archive, but 
this is increasingly the case. Similarly, not all archives have an 
associated search engine.

</para>

<para>

Initially, try locate the Mailing List Archive you are interested in by 
typing keywords and "mailing list archive" in an Internet search engine.

</para>

<para>

You may also find Mailing List archives at the following locations:

</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>

The website of the distribution of Linux you use.

</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>

The website of the Window Manager or Desktop Environment you use.

</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>

The website dedicated to the application or project in question.

</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>

<ulink url="http://www.mail-archive.com/lists.html">The Mail 
Archive</ulink>

</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>

<ulink url="http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/">Mailing List 
Archives</ulink>

</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>

This is not a complete listing of archives and you may find additional 
sites with an Internet search engine. But, this should certainly get you 
going.

</para>

</section>

<section id="howtos">

<title>HOWTOs</title>

<para>

HOWTOs are detailed reference documents on a specific subject, usually 
following a step-by-step approach. A HOWTO is a good document to help 
you discover a task or a topic you don't know. It will provide you with 
the basic steps and the major references.

</para>

<para>

These documents are particularly useful when you decide to provide or 
access a new service with your Linux system, or when you embark on a 
technically complex project. For example, you may have the option of 
accessing the 'net with a DSL or Cable Modem service - excellent guides 
are available in the form of HOWTOs.

</para>

<para>

Authors of these documents often include references and links to sites 
that they have found useful. You may find the information you need at 
one of these hyperlinked sites rather than in the HOWTO itself.

</para>

<!-- It would be nice to find a new relevant example to put here. -->

<para>

To find HOWTOs, the first place to go is the <ulink 
url="http://www.tldp.org">Linux Documentation Project (LDP)</ulink>. The 
LDP includes a <ulink 
url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX/howtos.html">HOWTO Index 
Page</ulink> that I suggest you bookmark in your browser.

</para>

<para>

These HOWTOs are written by Linux users and are periodically updated by 
the authors. Many authors provide the latest version at a personal 
website and a hyperlink to the latter is typically provided in the 
document. This version may be newer than the one available at the LDP 
website.

</para>

<para>

Note also that other HOWTOs are available, the authors of which have not 
submitted them to the LDP. It is definitely worthwhile trying to find 
these with an <link linkend="searchengines">Internet search 
engine</link>, using the "howto" keyword.

</para>

</section>

<section id="usersmanuals">

<title>Online User's Manuals</title>

<para>

Some of the major Linux distributions, Window Managers and Desktop 
Environments publish their user's manual online. If the entire manual is 
not online, installation and configuration guides are typically found at 
the relevant website. This also applies to major applications like the 
<emphasis>Gimp</emphasis> (GNU Image Manipulation Program) or 
<emphasis>Apache</emphasis>.

</para>

<para>

So, for those users who do not have the printed manual, a wealth of 
installation and configuration guidance is generally available online.

</para>

Online Unix References and Tutorials

</title>

<para>

As Linux is a Unix-like operating system, a general familiarity with 
fundamental Unix concepts such as the Unix directory hierarchy and file 
permissions is essential. Fortunately, there are many Unix tutorials
