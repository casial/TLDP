<title>Introduction</title>
<para>The purpose of this guide is to provide an easy solution for limiting incoming
traffic, thus preventing our LAN
users from consuming all the bandwidth of our internet link.</para>
<para>This is useful when our internet link is slow or our LAN users
download tons of mp3s and the newest Linux distro's *.iso files.</para>

<title>Before We Start</title>
<para>Let's imagine the following situation:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>We have 115,2 kbits/s ppp (modem) internet link (115,2/10
= 11,5 kbytes/s). Note: with eth connections
(network card) we would divide 115,2 by 8; with ppp we divide by 10, because
of start/stop bits (8 + 1 + 1 = 10).</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>We have some LAN stations and their users are doing bulk downloads
all the time.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>We want web pages to open fast, no matter how
many dowloads are happening.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Our internet interface is <command>ppp0</command>.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Our LAN interface is <command>eth0</command>.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Our network is 192.168.1.0/24</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<sect2>
<title>What do we need</title>
<para>Believe it or not, shaping the incoming traffic is an easy
task and you don't have to read tons of books about routing or queuing algorithms.
</para>
<para>To make it work, we need at least Squid proxy; if we want to fine tune
it, we will have to get familiar with ipchains or iptables and CBQ.</para>
<para>To test our efforts, we can install IPTraf.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>How does it work?</title>
<para>Squid is probably the most advanced HTTP proxy server available for Linux.
It can help us save bandwidth in two ways:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The first is a main characteristic of proxy servers -- they keep downloaded
web pages, pictures, and other objects in memory or on a disk. So, if two people are 
requesting the same web page, it isn't downloaded from the internet,
but from the local proxy. </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Apart from normal caching, Squid has a special feature called delay
pools. Thanks to delay pools, it is possible to limit internet traffic in a
reasonable way, depending on so-called 'magic words', existing in any given
URL. For example, a magic word could be '.mp3', '.exe' or '.avi', etc.
Any distinct part of a URL (such as .avi) can be defined as a magic word.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>With that, we can tell the Squid to download these kinds of files at a
specified speed (in our example, it will be about 5 kbytes/s). If our
LAN users download files at the same time, they will be downloaded
at about 5 kbytes/s altogether, leaving remaining bandwidth for web pages,
e-mail, news, irc, etc.</para>
<para>Of course, the Internet is not only used for downloading files via web
pages (http or ftp). Later on, we will deal with limiting bandwidth for Napster,
Realaudio, and other possibilities.</para>
</sect2></sect1>

<sect1 id="install">
<title>Installing and Configuring Necessary Software</title>
<para>Here, I will explain how to install the necessary software
so that we can limit and test the bandwidth usage.</para>
<sect2>
<title>Installing Squid with the delay pools feature</title>
<para>As I mentioned before, Squid has a feature called delay pools, which
allows us to control download bandwidth. Unfortunately, in most distributions,
Squid is shipped without that feature.</para>
<para>So if you have Squid already installed, I must disappoint you -- you
need to uninstall it and do it once again with delay pools enabled in the
way I explain below. </para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>To get maximum performance from our Squid proxy, it's best
to create a separate partition for its cache, called /cache/. Its size should
be about 300 megabytes, depending on our needs.</para>
<para>If you don't know how to make a separate partition, you can create the 
/cache/ directory on
a main partition, but Squid performance can suffer a bit.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>We add a safe 'squid' user:
</para>
<para><literal># useradd -d /cache/ -r -s /dev/null squid >/dev/null 2>&amp;1
</literal></para>
<para>No one can log in as squid, including root.

<title>Solving remaining problems</title>
<para>OK, we have installed Squid and configured it to use delay pools. I
bet nobody wants to be restricted, especially our clever LAN users. They will
likely try to avoid our limitations, just to download their favourite mp3s
a little faster (and thus causing your headache).</para>
<para>I assume that you use IP-masquerade on your LAN so that your users
could use IRC, ICQ, e-mail, etc. That's OK, but we must make
sure that our LAN users will use our delay pooled Squid to access web pages
and use <filename>ftp</filename>.</para>
<para>We can solve most of these problems by using <filename>ipchains</filename> (Linux
2.2.x kernels) or <filename>iptables</filename> (Linux 2.4.x kernels).</para>
<sect3>
<title>Linux 2.2.x kernels (ipchains)</title>
<para>We must make sure that nobody will try to cheat and use a proxy
server other than ours. Public proxies usually run on 3128 and 8080 ports:</para>

<para><command>/sbin/ipchains -A input -s 192.168.1.1/24 -d ! 192.168.1.1 8080
-p TCP -j REJECT</command></para>
<para>We must also make sure that nobody will try to cheat and connect to the
internet directly (IP-masquerade) to download web pages:</para>
<para><command>/sbin/ipchains -A input -s 192.168.1.1/24 -d ! 192.168.1.1 80
-p TCP -j REDIRECT 8080</command></para>
<para>If everything is working, we add these lines to the end of our initializing
scripts. Usually, it can be <literal>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</literal>.</para>
<para>We might think to block <filename>ftp</filename> traffic (ports
20 and 21) to force our LAN users to use Squid, but it's not a good idea
for at least two reasons:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Squid is a http proxy with <filename>ftp</filename> support,
not a real <filename>ftp</filename> proxy. It can download from <filename>

can't delete/change name of files on remote <filename>ftp</filename> servers.
</para>
<para>When we block ports 20 and 21, we won't be able to delete/change name
of files on remote <filename>ftp</filename> servers.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>IE5.5 has a bug -- it doesn't use a proxy

<para>When we block ports 20 and 21, we won't be able to browse through <filename>
ftp</filename> directories, using IE5.5.</para>

<sect1 id="cbq">
<title>Dealing with Other Bandwidth-consuming Protocols Using CBQ</title>
<para>We must remember that our LAN users can spoil our efforts from chapter
3, if they use Napster, Kazaa or Realaudio. We must also remember that we didn't
block <filename>ftp</filename> traffic in section 3.3.</para>
<para>We will achieve it in a different way -- not by limiting downloading directly,
but rather, indirectly. If our internet device is <literal>ppp0</literal>
and LAN device is <literal>eth0</literal>, we will limit outgoing traffic
on interface <literal>eth0</literal>, and thus, limit incoming traffic to <literal>
ppp0</literal>.</para>
<para>To do it, we will get familiar with CBQ and <filename>cbq.init</filename>
script. You can obtain it from <ulink url="ftp://ftp.equinox.gu.net/pub/linux/cbq/">
ftp://ftp.equinox.gu.net/pub/linux/cbq/</ulink>. Download <filename>cbq.init-v0.6.2
</filename> and put it in<filename> /etc/rc.d/</filename>.</para>
<para>You will also need <filename>iproute2</filename> installed. It comes
with every Linux distribution.</para>
<para>Now look in your <filename>/etc/sysconfig/cbq/</filename> directory.
There, you should have an example file, which should work with <filename>cbq.init
</filename>. If it isn't there, you probably don't have it compiled in your
kernel nor it isnt't present as modules. Well, in any case, just make that
directory, put example files provided below, and see
if it'd work for you.</para>
<sect2>
<title>FTP</title>
<para>In chapter 3, we didn't block ftp for two reasons -- so that we could do uploads, 
and so
that users with buggy IE5.5 could browse through <filename>ftp</filename>
directories. In all, our web browsers and <filename>ftp</filename> programs
should make downloads via our Squid proxy and <filename>ftp</filename> uploads/renaming/deleting
should be made via IP-masquerade.</para>
<para>We create a file called <filename>cbq-10.ftp-network</filename> in the <filename>
/etc/sysconfig/cbq/</filename> directory:</para>
<para><command># touch /etc/sysconfig/cbq/cbq-10.ftp-network</command></para>
<para>We insert the following lines into it:</para>
<programlisting>DEVICE=eth0,10Mbit,1Mbit
RATE=15Kbit
WEIGHT=1Kbit
PRIO=5
RULE=:20,192.168.1.0/24
RULE=:21,192.168.1.0/24</programlisting>
<para>You will find the description of thses lines in <filename>cbq.init-v0.6.2</filename> file.</para>
<para>When you start <filename>/etc/rc.d/cbq.init-v0.6.2</filename> script,
it will read your configuration, which is placed in <filename>/etc/sysconfig/cbq/</filename>:
</para>
<para><command># /etc/rc.d/cbq.init-v0.6.2 start</command></para>
<para>If everything is working, we add <filename>/etc/rc.d/cbq.init-v0.6.2 start
</filename> to the end of your initializing scripts. Usually, it can
be <filename>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</filename>.</para>
<para>Thanks to this command, your server will not send <filename>ftp</filename> data
through <filename>eth0</filename> faster than about 15kbits/s, and thus will not
download <filename>ftp</filename> data from the internet faster than 15kbits/s.Your LAN users
will see that it's more efficient to use Squid proxy for doing <filename>
ftp</filename> downloads. They will be also able to browse <filename>ftp</filename>
directories using their buggy IE5.5.</para>
<para>There is also another bug in IE5.5 - when you right click on a file
in a <filename>ftp</filename> directory then select 'Copy To Folder',
the file is downloaded not through proxy, but directly through IP-masquerade,
thus omitting Squid with delay pools.</para>
</sect2>

<title>Napster, Realaudio, Windows Media and other issues</title>
<para>Here, the idea is the same as with <filename>ftp</filename>; we just
add another port and set a different speed.</para>

<title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>
<sect2>
<title>Is it possible to limit bandwidth on a per-user basis with delay pools?
</title>
<para>Yes. Look inside the original <filename>squid.conf</filename> file and
check the Squid documentation on <ulink url="http://www.squid-cache.org">http://www.squid-cache.org
</ulink></para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>How do I make <command>wget</command> work with Squid?</title>
<para>It's simple. Create a file called <filename>.wgetrc</filename> and put it in your home directory.
Insert the following lines in it and that's it!</para>
<programlisting>
HTTP_PROXY=192.168.1.1:8080
FTP_PROXY=192.168.1.1:8080
</programlisting>
<para>You can make it work globally for all users, type <filename>man wget</filename> 
to learn how.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>I set up my own SOCKS server listening on port 1080, and now I'm not able to connect to
any irc server.</title>
<para>There can be two issues here.</para>
<para>One is when your SOCKS proxy is open relay, that means everyone can use it from any place in the world.
It is a security issue and you should check your SOCKS proxy configuration again - generally irc servers don't 
allow open relay SOCKS servers to connect to them.</para>
<para>If you are sure your SOCKS server isn't open relay, you may be still disallowed to connect to 
some of the irc servers - it's because mostly they just check if SOCKS server is running on port 1080 of a client
that is connecting. In that case just reconfigure your SOCKS to work on a different port. You will also have to
reconfigure your LAN software to use a proper SOCKS server and port.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>I don't like when Kazaa or Audiogalaxy is filling up all my upload bandwidth.</title>
<para>Indeed that can be painful, but it's simple to be solved.</para>
<para>Create a file called for example <filename>/etc/sysconfig/cbq/cbq-15.ppp</filename>.</para>
<para>Insert the following lines into it, and Kazaa or Audiogalaxy will upload not faster than
about 15 kbits/s. I assume that your outgoing internet interface is ppp0.</para>
<programlisting>
DEVICE=ppp0,115Kbit,11Kbit
RATE=15Kbit
WEIGHT=2Kbit
PRIO=5
TIME=01:00-07:59;110Kbit/11Kbit
RULE=,:21
RULE=,213.25.25.101
RULE=,:1214
RULE=,:41000
RULE=,:41001
#And so on till :41030
RULE=,:41030
</programlisting>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>My outgoing mail server is eating up all my bandwidth.</title>
<para>You can limit your SMTP, Postfix, Sendmail, or whatever, in a way similar to the question above.
Just change or add one rule:</para>
<programlisting>
RULE=,:25
</programlisting>
<para>Moreover, if you have an SMTP server, you can force your local LAN users to use it,
even though they have set up their own SMTP servers to smtp.some.server! We'll do it in a
transparent way we did before with Squid.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Can I limit my own FTP or WWW server in a manner similar it is shown in the question above?</title>
<para>Generally you can, but usually these servers have got their own bandwidth limiting
configurations, so you will probably want to look into their documentation.</para>
<para>2.2.x Kernels</para>
<para>
<command>/sbin/ipchains -A input -s 192.168.1.1/24 -d ! 192.168.1.1 25 -p TCP -j REDIRECT 25</command>
</para>
<para>2.4.x Kernels</para>
<para>
<command>/sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 25 
-j REDIRECT --to-port 25</command>
</para>
<para>Don't forget to add a proper line to your initializing scripts.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Is it possible to limit bandwidth on a per-user basis with <command>
cbq.init</command> script?</title>
<para>Yes. Look inside this script; there are some examples.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Whenever I start <filename>cbq.init</filename>, it says <filename>sch_cbq</filename> is missing.</title>
<para>Probably you don't have CBQ as modules in your system. If you have compiled CBQ into your kernel, comment out the
following lines in your <filename>cbq.init-v0.6.2</filename> script.</para>
<programlisting>
### If you have cbq, tbf and u32 compiled into kernel, comment it out
#for module in sch_cbq sch_tbf sch_sfq sch_prio cls_u32; do
#        if ! modprobe $module; then
#               echo "**CBQ: could not load module $module"
#               exit
#        fi
#done
</programlisting>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>CBQ sometimes doesn't work for no reason.</title>
<para>Generally it shouldn't occur. Sometimes, you can observe mass downloads, though you 
think you have blocked all ports Napster or Audiogalaxy uses. Well, there is always one more
port open for mass downloads. To find it, you can use IPTraf. As there can be possibly
thousands of such ports, it can be really hard task for you.
To make it easier, you can consider running your own SOCKS proxy - Napster, Audiogalaxy
and many programs can use SOCKS proxies, so it's much easier to deal with just one port, 
than to do so with thousands of possibilites (standard SOCKS port is 1080, if you run your 
own SOCKS proxy server, you will be able
to set it up differently, or run multiple instances of SOCKS proxy listening on
different ports). Don't forget to close all ports for traffic,
and leave open ports like 25 and 110 (SMTP and POP3), and other you think might be useful. You will
find a link to awesome Nylon socks proxy server at the end of this HOWTO.</para>

<sect2>
<title>Delay pools are stupid; why can't I download something at full speed
when the network is used only by me?</title>
<para>Unfortunately, you can't do much about it.</para>
<para>The only thing you can do is to use <command>cron</command> and reconfigure
it, for example, at 1.00 am, so that Squid won't use delay pools, then reconfigure
it again, let's say at 7.30 am, to use delay pools.</para>
<para>To do this, create two separate config files, called for example 
<filename>squid.conf-day</filename> and <filename>squid.conf-night</filename>, and put them into
<filename>/opt/squid/etc/</filename>.</para>
<para><filename>squid.conf-day</filename> would be the exact copy of a config we created earlier</para>
<para><filename>squid.conf-night</filename>, on the contrary, would not have any delay pool lines, so
all you have to do is to comment them out.</para>
<para>Next thing you have to do is to set up <filename>/etc/crontab</filename> entries correctly.</para>
<para>Edit <filename>/etc/crontab</filename> and put the following lines there:</para>
<programlisting>
#SQUID - night and day config change
01 9 * * * root /bin/cp -f /opt/squid/etc/squid.conf-day /opt/squid/etc/squid.conf; /opt/squid/bin/squid -k reconfigure
59 23 * * * root /bin/cp -f /opt/squid/etc/squid.conf-night /opt/squid/etc/squid.conf; /opt/squid/bin/squid -k reconfigure
</programlisting>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>My downloads break at 23:59 with "acl day time 09:00-23:59" in squid.conf. Can I do 
something about it?</title>
<para>You can achieve by removing that acl from your squid.conf, and "delay_access 2 allow dzien
delay_access 2 deny !dzien" as well.</para>
<para>Then try to do it with <command>cron</command> as in the question above.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Squid's logs grow and grow very fast, what can I do about it?</title>
<para>Indeed, the more users you have, the more - sometimes useful - information
will be logged.</para>
<para>The best way to eradicate it would be to use <command>logrotate</command>, but you'd have
to do a little trick to make it work with Squid: proper <command>cron</command> and 
<command>logrotate</command> entries.</para>
<para><filename>/etc/crontab</filename> entries:</para>
<programlisting>
#SQUID - logrotate
01 4 * * * root /opt/squid/bin/squid -k rotate; /usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf; /bin/rm -f /var/log/squid/*.log.0
</programlisting>
<para>Here we have caused <command>logrotate</command> to start daily at 04:01 am, so remove
any remaining <command>logrotate</command> starting points, for example from <filename>/etc/cron.daily/</filename>.</para>
<para><filename>/etc/logrotate.d/syslog</filename> entries:</para>
<programlisting>
#SQUID logrotate - will keep logs for 40 days
/var/log/squid/*.log.0 {
rotate 40
compress
daily
postrotate
/usr/bin/killall -HUP syslogd
endscript
}
</programlisting>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>CBQ is stupid; why can't I download something at full speed when the
network is used only be me?</title>
<para>Lucky you, it's possible!</para>
<para>There are to ways to achieve it.</para>
<para>The first is the easy one, similar to the solution we've made with Squid. Insert a line
similar to the one below to your CBQ config files placed in
<filename>/etc/sysconfig/cbq/</filename>:</para>
<programlisting>
TIME=00:00-07:59;110Kbit/11Kbit
</programlisting>
<para>You can have multiple TIME parameters in your CBQ config files.
</para>
<para>Be careful though, because there is a small bug in that <filename>cbq.init-v0.6.2</filename> script - it won't let you 
set certain times, for example 00:00-08:00! To make sure if everything is working correctly, 
start <filename>cbq.init-v0.6.2</filename>, and then within the time you set, type</para>
<para><command>/etc/rc.d/cbq.init-v0.6.2 timecheck</command></para>
<para>This is the example how the proper output should look like:</para>
<para><literal>
[root@mangoo rc.d]# ./cbq.init start; ./cbq.init timecheck</literal>
<literal>**CBQ:  3:44: class 10 on eth0 changed rate (20Kbit -> 110Kbit)</literal>
<literal>**CBQ:  3:44: class 40 on ppp0 changed rate (15Kbit -> 110Kbit)</literal>
<literal>**CBQ:  3:44: class 50 on eth0 changed rate (35Kbit -> 110Kbit)</literal></para>
<para>In this example something went wrong, probably in the second config file placed in
<filename>/etc/sysconfig/cbq/</filename>; second counting from the lowest number in its name:</para>
<para><literal>[root@mangoo rc.d]# ./cbq.init start; ./cbq.init timecheck
**CBQ:  3:54: class 10 on eth0 changed rate (20Kbit -> 110Kbit)</literal>
<literal>./cbq.init: 08: value too great for base (error token is "08")</literal></para>
<para>The second way to make CBQ more intelligent is harder - it doesn't depend on time. You can read about it in the Linux
2.4 Advanced Routing HOWTO, and play with <filename>tc</filename> command.</para>
