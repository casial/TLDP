    <title>Linux Installation using a Remote Insight Lights-Out</title>

    <para>
    After you have installed the card into the server system you will
    need to set up a Linux distribution repository, build and download
    a special boot floppy, and drive the installation through a
    browser.
    </para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Hardware Installation</title>
      
      <para>
        The first step is to install the Remote Insight Lights-Out
        Edition card in a Compaq ProLiant Server and configure it for
        network access.  Using DHCP is the easiest way to get the
        Remote Insight Lights-Out card on the network.
      </para>

    </sect2>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>Setting up a Linux Distribution Point</title>
      
      <para>
        On another server, make the contents of the
        Red Hat installation CD available via HTTP or FTP.  For this
        example, the server is named disto.OUR-LAB.com and HTTP is
        used.
      </para>


      <para>
        Copy the entire CD to the local hard disk and give appropriate
        file protections to allow the web server to read it.  For Red
        Hat V6.2, use the following commands.

        <programlisting>
	 # mount -t iso9660 -o ro /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
	 # mkdir /usr/src/distros/RH62
	 # (cd /mnt/cdrom && tar cf - . ) | (cd /usr/src/RHCD && tar xvfp - )
	 # umount /mnt/cdrom
	 # chmod +x -R /usr/src/distros/RH62
        </programlisting>

	Red Hat V7.0 and later versions contain two binary
	distribution CDs, so both need to be copied into the same
	directory structure. This example shows the steps for Red Hat
	7.2.  Put the first binary distribution CD into the drive and
	as above use the following commands:

        <programlisting>
	 # mount -t iso9660 -o ro /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
	 # mkdir /usr/src/distros/RH72
	 # (cd /mnt/cdrom && tar cf - . ) | (cd /usr/src/distros/RH72 && tar xvfp - )
	 # umount /mnt/cdrom
        </programlisting>

	Then put the second binary distribution CD into the drive and
	issue the following commands.

        <programlisting>
	 # mount -t iso9660 -o ro /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
	 # mkdir /usr/src/distros/RH72
	 # (cd /mnt/cdrom && tar cf - . ) | (cd /usr/src/distros/RH72 && tar xvfp - )
	 # umount /mnt/cdrom
	 # chmod +x -R /usr/src/distros/RH72
        </programlisting>


      </para>

      <para>
        Edit httpd.conf to add the following lines near the section
        wehre other Aliases are defined.  The location of the
        configuration file varies.  On a default Red Hat system, it is
        in <filename>/etc/httpd/httpd.conf</filename>. If the Apache
        server was installed from sources using the default location,
        it is in
        <filename>/usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf</filename>.  You
        can also try <command>locate httpd.conf</command> to find it.
        

        <programlisting>
	&lt;Directory /usr/src/distros/&gt;
		Options Indexes
		AllowOverride all
        &lt;/Directory&gt;

	Alias /distros	/usr/src/distros
       </programlisting>

       </para>


      <para>
        Restart the Apache server.  If you are still running the
        default Apache shipped with Red Hat, do this:

        <programlisting>
	# /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart
        </programlisting>
      </para>

      <para>
        Other Linux distributions may put the Apache Web Server
        startup script in a different place.
      </para>

      <para>
         The location of of apachectl may vary; find it with
         <command>locate apachectl</command>. If you installed
         the Apache server yourself, you may want to use apachectl.
         If you used the Apache default file locations, it would be
         the following.

        <programlisting>
 	# /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl restart
        </programlisting>

       </para>

      <para>
        Verify that the Red Hat content is available:

        <programlisting>
	# lynx http://distro.OUR-LAB.com/distros
        </programlisting>
      </para>

      <title>Creating a Virtual Floppy Disk</title>

      <para>

        Create a special Red Hat boot floppy that can perform a network
        installation.  The file from the Red Hat CD is in
        <filename>images/bootnet.img</filename>;in this example, 
        <filename>/usr/src/distros/RH72/images/bootnet.img</filename> or 
        <filename>http://distro.OUR-LAB.com/distros/RH72/images/bootnet.img</filename>.
        Other distributions can also install across the network using
        similar steps.

      </para>
        
      <para>
        From a Linux or UNIX system follow these steps.  
        Put a floppy in the drive.

        <programlisting>
	# dd if=/usr/src/distros/RH72/images/bootnet.img of=/dev/fd0 bs=1440k
        </programlisting>
       </para>

      <para>
        Take that special boot floppy to a Microsoft Windows system
        that has the <filename>CPQIMAGE</filename> program to build an
        IMG file from a floppy to be uploaded to the Compaq Remote
        Insight Lights-Out card.  This is the only step that requires
        the use of a Microsoft platform. The
        <filename>CPQIMAGE</filename> program is not available on any
        other platform.
      </para>


      <para>
	The <filename>CPQIMAGE</filename> program for Microsoft
	Windows 95/98/NT 4.0/2000 is available for download from
	<ulink
	url="http://www.compaq.com/manage/lightsout-downloads.html">
	http://www.compaq.com/manage/lightsout-downloads.html</ulink>.
	Choose the "Diskette Image Utility" download.

      </para>


      <para>
	Build a file named <filename>redhat-bootnet.img</filename>
        using that Windows-based application.  Note for multi-system
        installations, this file can be reused or simply provided to
        the customer.

        Put the name of the web server with the Red Hat distribution
        for the hostname, in this example, distro.OUR-LAB.com.  The
        directory for this example is <filename>/rh</filename>.  If you didn't previously
        specify a DNS server in the TCP/IP configuration step prior to
        this, you can use the IP address of the system serving the
        distribution.

        If you want to run a graphical interface on your server
        system, it can be configured later using
        <filename>Xconfigurator</filename> or
        <filename>xf86config</filename>.  Compaq suggests that the
        server resolution be set to 640x480 at 16-bit color depth
        and mouse acceleration to be 1x.

        Proceed with a normal Red Hat installation.  Note that there
        is a 15 minute timeout for the Remote Console, if your Red Hat
        installation takes longer than that you may be disconnected
        from the Remote Console.  If this happens, simply reconnect to
        the URL https://XX.XX.XX.XX, where the X's are the IP address
        assigned to the card, and continue from where you left off.

      <para>

	The default configuration for the grub bootloader that Red Hat
	7.2 installs goes into graphics mode for the boot selection.
	While the Remote Console will work properly, it looks nicer if
	there is no splash image.  To do this, edit /etc/grub.conf and
	remove or comment out the line that looks like:

        <programlisting>
		splashimage=(hd0,1)/grub/splash.xpm.gz
        </programlisting>

	and add the following line:

        <programlisting>
		terminal --dumb --timeout=3 console
        </programlisting>
