	<title>Knowledge Required</title>

<para>
With all the help from major Linux distributions such as SuSE, Redhat and many others, Linux based systems are becoming easier to use.  However, there is still some need of understanding of basic Unix skills to make the most of Linux.  Thus, this HOWTO will assume that the reader has at least a basic knowledge of using a Unix system including the ability to compile and install programs.
</para>
<para>
A few resources we have found useful over the years include:

Similarly, this is not a tutorial or reference for astronomy principles or astronomical instrumentation. Astronomy is perhaps the grandest of all sciences, employing widely disparate disciplines in a bold attempt to understand nothing less than the universe itself. Your interests will lead in many directions. A few references we have used include:

<sect2>
	<title>Scope</title>
<para>
The authors define the scope of this HOWTO as primarily an index to Linux tools applicable in some fashion to the pursuit of Astronomy. It is NOT our intention to list WWW astronomy references in general. Our own interests tend more toward the technology than the pure science and so we welcome contributions from others who have found Linux tools which contribute in other ways to Astronomy. Please contact us at the address above.
