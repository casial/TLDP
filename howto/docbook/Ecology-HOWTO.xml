   The Linux-Ecology-HOWTO discusses ways to make computers less harmful to
   our environment and to solve some ecological issues.  It explains how to
   use Linux to save power and consumables like paper and ink. Since it does
   not require big hardware, Linux may be used with old computers to make
   their life cycle longer. Games may be used in environmental education and
   software is available to simulate ecological processes.

Some of the recommendations in this text are discussed controversial, for instance: powering down a device, when it's not in use. This may save power, but not under all circumstances. Also it may have other additional ecological costs, e.g. the life time of the device can be shortened.
</para>

I don't have enough technological knowledge to make a decision between these alternatives. Also some alternatives might be rated differently by different persons. So finally the decision what to choose is up to you. Anyway if you have better alternatives please let me know.

<title>Reduction of Power Consumption</title>

<para>
There are some means to save power when using a computer which are supported by Linux: Advanced Power Management, certain harddisk settings, working without monitor and others.
</para>

<sect1 id="ecology-howto-power-management">
<title>Advanced Power Management (APM/ACPI)</title>

<para>
Putting your GNU/Linux PC in suspend or hibernate mode.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>ACPI</title>

<para>
Most modern PCs support the ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) standard.
The <ulink url="http://acpi.sourceforge.net/">ACPI4Linux</ulink> project works on
implementing full ACPI support in the Linux kernel, including fan control, dock/undock detection.
</para>

<para>
All ACPI related information (such as processor or board temperature) is available through files
in <filename>/proc/acpi</filename>. For example, this makes it very easy for desktop environments
(or for your own programs) to display to temperature information somewhere on your screen.
</para>

<sect3>
<title>Hibernate to disk</title>

<para>
Use hibernate to disk and no longer be afraid
of switching off your system. Booting is much faster
than having to wait for services and graphics
to start up. Actually, most of the time is saved by getting back to your work
as you left it before suspending your computer (open files, terminals, browser windows).
There is no need to re-open everything!
</para>

<para>
While hibernating is often considered as a power saving solution
for notebook computers, it should also be used for desktop computers,
to save AC power. Use it when you go for lunch, when you leave the office
in the evening or for holidays...
</para>

<para>
Hibernating also saves a lot of time when you replace a battery of a notebook.
Again, hibernate, install a fresh battery, power up and get back to your
work as you left it off.

From the 
<ulink url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Battery-Powered/index.html">Battery Powered Linux Mini-HOWTO</ulink>
&quot; .. for APM to work on any notebook or energy-conscious desktop, the system BIOS ROM in the machine must support the APM standard. Furthermore, for APM to work with the Linux operating system, the system BIOS ROM must support either the 1.0 or 1.1 version of the APM standard, and it must also support 32-bit protected mode connections. A system that supports APM 1.1 is preferred, as it provides more features that the device driver and supporting utilities can take advantage of.&quot;
You may get information about the APM version with the <command>dmesg</command> command and in the <filename>/proc/apm</filename> file. 
</para>

<sect3>
<title>Introduction</title>


<para>
When you first install Linux, you will probably have to recompile the kernel. The kernel that came with your distribution probably does not have APM enabled.
</para>

<para>
APM support consists of two parts: <command>kernel</command> support and <command>user-land</command> support.
</para>

<para>
For <command>kernel</command> support, enable the parameters in the corresponding kernel section. AFAIK not all features work with laptops. AFAIK the feature <command>CONFIG_APM_POWER_OFF</command> works with most laptops.
</para>

<para>
The utilities for <command>userland</command> support may be found at <ulink url="http://www.worldvisions.ca/~apenwarr/apmd/">WorldVisions</ulink>. APMD is a set of programs that control the Advanced Power Management system found in most modern laptop computers. If you run a 2.2.x kernel and want to experiment, Gabor Kuti &lt;seasons at falcon.sch.bme.hu&gt; has made a kernel patch that allows you to <command>hibernate</command> any Linux system to disk, even if your computers APM BIOS doesn't support it directly.

If you have another operating system preinstalled or use another operating system at the same disk, make sure there is no "hibernation" or "suspend" tool installed, which could severely interfere with Linux, e.g. it might use disk space which is occupied by Linux or vice versa.

<title>Troubleshooting</title>

<para>
Sometimes X windows and APM don't work smoothly together, the machine might even hang. A recommendation from Steve Rader: Some Linux systems have their X server hang when doing <command>apm -s</command>. Folks with this affliction might want switch to the console virtual terminal then suspend <command>chvt 1; apm -s</command> as root, or, more appropriately, <command>sudo chvt 1; sudo apm -s</command>. I have these commands in a script, say, <command>my-suspend</command> and then do <command>xapmload --click-command my-suspend</command> .
</para>

<para>
On some new machines (for instance HP Omnibook 4150 - 366 MHz model) when accessing <filename>/proc/apm</filename>, you may get a kernel fault <command>general protection fault: f000</command>. <ulink url="http://www.canb.auug.org.au/~sfr/">Stephen Rothwell</ulink> explains: "This is your APM BIOS attempting to use a real mode segment while in protected mode, i.e. it is a bug in your BIOS. .. We have seen a few of these recently, except all the others are in the power off code in the BIOS wher we can work around it by returning to real mode before attempting to power off. Here we cannot do this."

- A feature implemented in the Linux kernel since the 2.6.6 version.

and save battery life. Control scripts are shipped by default by recent
distributions.

<listitem>
<para>
<ulink url="http://muru.com/linux/dyntick/">Dynamic Tick</ulink>
is available since kernel 2.6.21 and later.
When enabled, this kernel feature allows to disable the
CPU timer interrupts when all processors are idle.
This way, idle systems are not woken up every 4 ms
(default setting in Linux 2.6) just to realize there is nothing to do!
This can save a little bit of power in notebooks
(and CPU cycles in virtual hosting servers). 
Regular timer interrupts are re-enabled when something
really happens, when a real hardware interrupt is received.
In kernel configuration, this feature can be selected
from the <command>Kernel Features</command>
section (<command>NO_IDLE_HZ</command> setting).
You can verify whether it is enabled with 
<command>cat /boot/config-$(uname -r) | grep CONFIG_NO_HZ</command>.

The <command>noatime</command> and <command>nodiratime</command>

In operating systems like Linux which comply with the POSIX standard,
filesystems are supposed to record the last time files are read.
With default kernel settings, even if files are read from the file
cache in RAM, this causes time data to be written to disk every
5 seconds. You may use a line like this 
<command>/dev/hda3   /data   ext3   defaults,noatime,nodiratime, 1 2</command> for example
in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>.
</para>

Do they only prevent the screen from being burned in or do they save power, too?
</para>

<para>
Some recommendations from Wade Hampton:
Screensavers usually display graphics, look for ETI, or perform other tasks.  When using your screensaver in this manner, you may actually consume MORE power. For example a computer using XSETI as a screensaver might get far warmer (hence use more power) than when it was being used to edit a document or perform a compile.

The purpose of <command>xscreensaver</command> is to display pretty pictures
on your screen when it is not in use, in keeping with the philosophy that
unattended monitors should always be doing something interesting, just like
they do in the movies. The benefit that this program has over the
combination of the <command>xlock</command> and
<command>xautolock</command> programs is the ease with which new graphics
hacks can be  installed: you don't need to recompile this program to add a
new display mode, you just change some resource settings. Any program which
can be  invoked in such a way that it draws on the root window of the screen
can now be used as a screensaver without modification.  The programs that
are being run as screensavers don't need to have any special knowledge about
what it means to be a screensaver.

To really save power, and if your X server plus monitor supports it, use the <command>dpms</command> option of <command>xset</command> (see the manual page for <command>xset</command>). For example, to enable the DPMS (Energy Star) features of you X server: <command>xset +dpms</command>
</para>

<para>
You may also manually change the mode of your X display: 
</para>
<programlisting>
xset dpms force standby
xset dpms force suspend
xset dpms force off

<para>
Note that <command>suspend</command> and <command>off</command> usually save much more energy than just <command>standby</command>,
especially in CRT displays.

According to manufacturers, switching off LCD displays more often doesn't
reduce their lifetime. As user can easily notice, there is no significant penalty
either between suspend and off modes in terms of switching on time.

AFAIK a CRT consumes on the order of 25 percent more power when displaying a <command>plain white</command> screen than displaying a <command>plain black</command> screen. So, a screensaver that's mostly black can help save power, even if it doesn't actually use DPMS to power down the screen. Of course, one that's very bright and colourful, or that keeps the CPU running fast is not much help.

<title>Virtual Servers: Consolidation and Virtualization</title>

<para>
Several technologies now make it possible to run several GNU/Linux servers
inside a real, physical GNU/Linux server.  As in physical servers, each virtual server
is isolated from the others. So, this approach retains the benefits of
separate servers, but makes it possible to share some hardware resources
like the CPU and network bandwidth. On the other hand, each virtual server
enjoys a reserved amount of RAM and disk space.

The benefits of virtual servers are obvious in terms of cost, power consumption,
optimum use of hardware resources, and consumption of computer materials.
There is another key advantage for hardware maintenance: virtuals servers

I had a chance to discuss Energy Star with the designers of desktop printers. They confirmed that the allowable stand-by power targets depend on the device, and they only knew their targets. But they made some other interesting comments: 

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
Energy Star ratings lead to significant operational power savings. Timer based power savings are the exception. Most savings come from designing in power on demand with low leakage drivers. For example, using stepper motors with low leakage current instead of high leakage.
</para>
<para>
This savings is both from individual designs and from the resulting demand for low leakage products causing better and cheaper low leakage product designs. The old-style (e.g. typewriter) design with one motor (always on) and various clutches is no longer the least cost.
</para>

</listitem>



<listitem>
<para>
Energy Star was good organizational engineering. It never required designers to compromise quality or performance, which made it much harder to argue against design changes to reduce power consumption while idle. Since most of the savings begin the millisecond that parts stop moving, these savings are considerable.
</para>

<listitem>
<para>
The power ratings on PC's are a safety rating, not a usage rating. So the 235W and 300W power supplies that commonly found in PCs are specifying their safety limits. Actual full power usage is much less, typically 20-30 percent of the safe limit. The designers also noted that it is actually difficult to measure the power consumption of a switching power supply. You need to use specially designed power meters. The regular AC meters are designed for motors, and are rather inaccurate for switching power supplies.

Linux halts the CPU in the idle cycle to further reduce power consumption. Early reports of OS/2, Win3.1/95, NT, and Linux showed Linux to use far less power than DOS-based O/S's that spun in the idle loop and consumed power -- this may have changed hence it would need research to validate.

Then arrange  the  stack  of  paper  for printing on the other side.  (If it's punched, the holes  will  now be  on  the  left.)  On our II NTX, the paper comes out blank-side up; replace it  in  the  tray  still blank-side  up  but rotated 180 degrees.  For other printers, you figure it out.

  This project has a very limited usefulness as it is currently

Compressed read-only filesystems
</para>

<para>
- The idea is store parts of the system (typically executables and libraries through
the <command>/bin</command>, <command>/sbin</command> and
<command>/usr</command> directories) in a separate, compressed and read-only
filesystem. This is great for saving space and for protecting the system from
extern attacks. However, the constraint is that software upgrades can no
longer be done when the filesystem is mounted. The whole filesystem contents must
be rebuilt and replaced at once.

is the solution everyone should use now. Unlike CramFS, it has

On slow storage (like USB flash drives), replacing ext2

Kernel: If your needs are fitted with an older kernel version, you can save some space.
</para>

<para>
However, with old kernels, you will miss cool features (such as real-time preemption,
making your system much more responsive) and support for recent peripherals.
It is true that the Linux kernel accumulated bloat over the years: more features, support for more special cases...
Now that Linux is taking an increasingly dominant place in embedded systems, work is being done to control the kernel size.
The <ulink url="http://www.selenic.com/linux-tiny/">LinuxTiny</ulink> project releases a set of patches to
the Linux kernel sources. In the <command>Configure Standard Kernel Features for Small Systems</command>
kernel configuration section, you can unselect features you do not need in a simple computer.
The minimum compressed size you can achieve for a Linux 2.6 kernel for a simple PC is approximately 350 KB. 
Note that more and more LinuxTiny changes are now available in the standard Linux kernel (no patching necessary).
</para>

<para>
With the latest kernel releases, you may also try 
the <ulink url="http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt">
real-time preemption patches</ulink> from Ingo Molnar.
When full preemption is enabled, it adds unprecedented
responsiveness to the Linux kernel. The latency is much reduced,
suitable for real real-time systems (less than 100 us!).
It is definitely worth trying on old systems
to give them a new youth and improve the user experience!

   is to run the Linux kernel in such a way that it can handle defective RAM modules.
   With defective RAM, I mean RAM which has some bits wrong at some (known)
   addresses. Normally, such RAM is considered useless and thrown away; the
   larger RAMs get, the higher the chances of failing addresses. With ever
   growing RAM sizes, it would therefore be pleasant to have an alternative to
   discarding of defective RAM chips.

<title>Uninterruptible Power Supply - UPS</title>

<para>
You should use a protection against lightening and power surges or a UPS
if you have many thunderstorms in the area.
That will save hardware, software, your time, and money, and help prevent you from throwing out

For details consult the <ulink url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/UPS-HOWTO.html">UPS-HOWTO</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
For desktop PCs, in areas prone to lightening or power outages, UPSs could save hours
of work each week, potentially translating into power savings.
However, there is some concern over their additional usage of AC power.
If anyone has any studies or research on this issue, could they please forward it to us?
That would be an interesting question to post to APC, BEST, etc.
</para>

<para>
UPSs also contain batteries with a high environmental cost.
So, just use a UPS when really needed and when benefits
outweight environmental costs. 
For example, if you are using a notebook, a much cheaper surge protection is enough
thanks to your battery.

<ulink url="http://www.uncert.com/">UNCERT</ulink> is a geostatistical uncertainty analysis package applied to groundwater flow and contaminant transport modeling. This package was developed for evaluating the inherent uncertainty in describing subsurface geology, hydraulic properties, and the migration of hazardous contaminants in groundwater flow systems. It is well suited for the aforementioned purposes, but is also sufficiently general to be usable by researchers in a wide range of disciples.

   Scientists of 
   <ulink url="http://www.reuse-computer.de/">ReUse project</ulink>
   located at the 
   <ulink url="http://www.tu-berlin.de/">Technical University of Berlin</ulink> recently compared the
   energy consumption of different computer types along the life cycle. The
   production of computers actually needs 535 kWh which is 10 % less than 4
   years ago. Most of the energy will be consumed while the computer is used
   for example at work for 8 hours/day. The energy consumption of new
   computers with 2,5-3 GHz processors is even in the
   stand-bye-mode still 100 Watt, whereas a 1,4 GHz PC needs 80
   Watt and a 4 year old PC only needed 60 Watt. Therefore from the
   ecological point of view it is better to buy an old computer
   that didn't need the energy for a new production and which
   consumes less electricity while it is being used.
</para>

<para>
   LCD displays need less energy than other monitors. For this reason
   laptops are the most ecological types of the compared computers. They
   need the smallest amount of energy when they are used. And 3 year old
   laptops are better than new ones since their processors need less
   energy than new examples. There is also an article in the
   German computer magazine

<para>
   Quoted from the <ulink
   url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/PCMCIA-HOWTO.html">PCMCIA-HOWTO</ulink>:
   &quot;Card Services can be compiled with support for APM
   (Advanced Power Management) if you've configured your kernel
   with APM support. ...  The PCMCIA modules will automatically
   be configured for APM if a compatible version is detected on
   your system. Whether or not APM is configured, you can use
   <command>cardctl suspend</command> before suspending your
   laptop, and <command>cardctl resume</command> after resuming,
   to cleanly shut down and restart your PCMCIA cards. This will
   not work with a modem that is in use, because the serial
   driver isn't able to save and restore the modem operating
   parameters. APM seems to be unstable on some systems. If you
   experience trouble with APM and PCMCIA on your system, try to
   narrow down the problem to one package or the other before
   reporting a bug. Some drivers, notably the PCMCIA SCSI
   drivers, cannot recover from a suspend/resume cycle.  When
   using a PCMCIA SCSI card, always use <command>cardctl
   eject</command> prior to suspending the system.&quot;

If you don't need infrared support,
disable it in the BIOS or shutdown the

IrDA features of the kernel which are
useful for saving power.

In the specifications of my HP
OmniBook 800 it is recommended to turn
off the IR port, if it is not in use,
because it may consume up to 10
percent of the battery time.

If necessary, you may also try to
disable the <command>Fast RRs</command> feature in the IrDA
section of the kernel. This option
will give you much better latencies

   implements laptop computer support functions, it includes a dockable
   battery status monitor for laptops - in short a little icon in the
   KDE status bar that shows how much battery time you have left. It
   also will warn you when power is getting low and allows you to
   configure power saving options.

<title>Appendix D - Recommendations for Buying a New Computer</title>


<para>
Courtesy of Wade Hampton (modifications by wh): Purchase a low-power computer such as a laptop or network computer. These typically don't use as much power as desktop systems. For example, someone on the WWW had a Corel/Rebel Netwinder powered by solar cells. I find it funny that an "Energy Star" desktop still has a 300W power supply and uses far more power than a computer like the Netwinder which uses something like 10 Watts of power, (though this is consistent with the Energy Star goals for computer equipment, since they have targeted unused power consumption).
</para>

<para>
Maybe there should be a new class of computers called "Energy Miser" (or similar) that use nearly an order of magnitude less power than Energy Star systems?
</para>

<para>
To save power for the display, one could purchase a LCD monitor instead of a CRT. LCD monitors consume 30-40 Watts of power versus the 100's of Watts used by most monitors.  The price of an LCD is still 2-3 times that of a similar monitor, but as LCDs become more widely used, the price will come down.
</para>

<para>
Make sure that any new computer purchase includes APM-compliant hardware and low-radiation. Use TCO, DPMS or Energy Star compliant monitors.

R Horn &lt;rjh at world.std.com&gt; wrote: " I personally have found the <ulink url="http://eande.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley Labs - LBL</ulink> web site to be the best source for information on energy efficient equipment. They go into considerable details on how to reduce energy consumption from many kinds of equipment, including much more than computers.  They also have a good collection of links to related sites. The Energy Star program is defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency, which has a web site on it. So far all of the Energy Star regulations have been defined to reduce energy usage without requireing change or restrictions on regular usage.  There is an amazingly large amount of electricity consumed by idle equipment (computers, televisions, microwave ovens,...) and also large amounts consumed unnecessarily by equipment that must be continuously one (emergency exit signs, traffic lights, ...). Since this energy can be saved without asking users to make any compromises on performance, it is being targeted first.
</para>

<para>
Somewhere on the LBL web site they have the actual power consumption figures for various PCs. The 300W power supply is quite misleading. Actual power usage varies depending upon what programs you run and whether the disks can be powered down. Genuine usage while in operation is usually in the 50-75W range. When the system is idle, it drops significantly.
</para>

<para>
The NetWinder is a nice machine, but does force operational compromises. The peak CPU performance is much lower.  The operating system is not Windows.  And there are other limitations. A closer comparison is the typical laptop PC.  These can generally be operated from a modest solar panel because their average power drain is quite low.  With these you can see the cost vs power consumption tradeoff. They achieve the same performance as the desktop units, but the low power consumption has doubled or tripled the cost.
</para>

<para>
(I personally use a Psion.  A decent slow computer that requires only 200mw of power. It may even run Linux once they deal with some of the ROM issues.)
</para>

<para>
The big debate in setting the energy star regulations was deciding which would have greater overall benefit: small negligible cost improvements to almost all equipment sold, or greater improvements at much higher cost? Could that cost be invested elsewhere to greater benefit?  How will the purchasers react to the higher cost? So far the consensus has been that improving a large number of machines at negligible cost is wiser than improving a smaller number of machines at high cost."

<title>Appendix E - A New Environmentally Friendly Hardware Design</title>

Courtesy of Wade Hampton and Knut Suebert: New hardware designs that plan

such as low-power CPUs e.g., the ARM from Intel: 
<!--

, environmentally friendly battery design, low-power displays (e.g., non-backlit LCDs), smaller packaging, etc.  Linux supports a WIDE variety of hardware and technologies. These could be leveraged into powerful, flexible, environmentally friendly Linux-based solutions.

<para>
An "Environmental Rating" could be created for new Linux-based hardware and even some Linux-based software such as <command>bottlerocket</command> (X10). Devices such as the Netwinder or the uCsimm would receive high ratings for their size, power consumption, capabilities, etc.

When computer waste processing channels are not available yet in

will become available over the years.
