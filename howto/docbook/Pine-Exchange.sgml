    </Para>
  </ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
</Para>

<Sect1 id="requirements">
<Title>Requirements</Title>

<Para>
I assume if you are reading this HOWTO, you probably already meet the requirements, but here they are anyhow:

<ItemizedList>
  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    Have a working knowledge of the Pine email client (There is little to no
    documentation in this HOWTO on using Pine). If you need more information
    on using Pine, check out their main website. (see Resources) 
    </Para>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    A username/password in order to log into the Exchange Server (Exchange
    servers run in a Microsoft domain, so your Exchange logon will be the same  
    as your domain logon).
    </Para>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    Befriend the SysAdmin of your Exchange Server (You may or may not need the
    help of this person depending on which services are running).
    </Para>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    The Exchange Server must be version 5.5 or greater (Exchange did not
    support IMAP until 5.5).
    </Para>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    Pine started supporting IMAP with v2.0 and LDAP with v4.0. I would
    recommend upgrading to the newest version, at the release of this document
    v4.44 or at least v4.0 or greater.

<Sect1 id="communication">
<Title>Communication</Title>

<Para>
These are the protocols that will facilitate communication between the Pine
client and the Exchange Server: IMAP, SMTP, and LDAP.  (see Resources)

<ItemizedList>
  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) - This protocol will provide you
      access to all your messages and folders on the Exchange Server.
    </Para>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) - This protocol will allow you to send
      outgoing Internet email.
    </Para>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) - This protocol will provide
      you access to the Global Address List on the Exchange Server.

  </ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
</Para>

</Sect1>

<Sect1 id="exchange">
<Title>Exchange Server Configuration</Title>

<Para>
Before starting to work on your Pine configuration, you must make sure that the
Exchange Server is configured correctly. This is where your SysAdmin comes in to
play. You need to make sure the IMAP, SMTP, and LDAP services are all running.
These services could potentially be running on separate servers, so you need to
consult your SysAdmin.
</Para>

<Para>
On Exchange Server 5.5, IMAP and LDAP are installed and running in the default
installation. SMTP has to be installed separately, and comes in an add-on package
called Microsoft Exchange Connector, specifically for sending mail on the
Internet.
</Para>

<Para>
NOTE: You can manually check to see if these services are running by telneting
to their respective ports. (ie. IMAP:143, SMTP:25, and LDAP:389)
</Para>

</Sect1>

<Sect1 id="pine">
<Title>Pine Configuration</Title>

<Para>
Pine has three types of configuration files we will concern ourselves with. Each
of them can contain all the same settings, but with varied syntax. The decreasing
order of precedence for each setting is as follows: /etc/pine.conf.fixed,
~/.pinerc, and /etc/pine.conf. Basically this means if Pine is looking for a
specific setting it first checks pine.conf.fixed, if it does not exist it checks
~/.pinerc, if it does not exist it finally checks /etc/pine.conf.

<ItemizedList>
  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    ~/.pinerc -- This is the local user copy of the configuration file. It is
    located in the root of the users home directory it only affects that user.
    You should use this configuration if you do not have superusers/root access
    on the computer on which you are using Pine. To generate a new configuration
    file of this type, you issue the command 'pine -pinerc .pinerc.new'.
    </Para>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    /etc/pine.conf -- This is the site-wide Pine configuration file, so it
    affects all the users running Pine on that machine (It can only be installed
    by the superuser/root account). The syntax is slightly different than the
    ~/.pinerc file since it has to represent all the users on the system, not
    just one. To generate a new configuration file of this type, you issue the
    command 'pine -conf &#62 pine.conf.new'.
    </Para>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    /etc/pine.conf.fixed -- This has exactly the same purpose and syntax as the
    /etc/pine.conf file, except for one property. This file is not overridden
    by the users ~/.pinerc file. Basically all the settings in this file are
    enforced, and cannot be changed by the user. Initially this file should be
    empty. You should add settings to it as needed.
    </Para>
  </ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
</Para>

<Para>
Each of these files contain settings in the form of "key=value" pairings. You
can change these settings with your favorite editor (ex. vi). For the ~/.pinerc
file the user can change the settings directly from Pine, by going into (S)etup
then (C)onfig. For LDAP settings go into (S)etup then (D)irectory.
</Para>

<Para>
Here are the important settings for communicating with the Exchange Server:
</Para>

<Para>
NOTE: The syntax of each setting will be shown in the Example configuration.

<ItemizedList>
  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    user-domain -- The domain name portion of your email address (So if your
      email address is user@yourcompany.com, then yourcompany.com would be
      your user-domain).
    </Para>
  </ListItem>

  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    customized-hdrs -- This is the actually "From:" header that will appear in
    the message that you compose before you send it out. If you don't specify 
    this header, the user and full name are taken from the system
    /etc/passwd file. There are other variations to setting up the "From:"
    header (see Resources).
    </Para>
  </ListItem>

  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    smtp-server -- The hostname of your SMTP server. This may or may not be the
      same as your Exchange Server. (With SMTP Authentication you will need to
      specify a "/user" parameter on the end of this setting).
    </Para>
  </ListItem>

  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    inbox-path -- This contains the default path to your INBOX. (This should
      point to the remote INBOX on your Exchange/IMAP server).
    </Para>
  </ListItem>

  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    folder-collections -- This contains points to other folder collections you
      wish to view. There are only two sets you should concern yourself with.
      The first is your INBOX folders (personal folders you create in your
      INBOX), and the second is your Mailbox folders, which are default folders 
      (ie.  Sent Items, Deleted Items, Drafts, Outbox, Public Folders, etc.)
    </Para>
  </ListItem>

  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    default-fcc -- This folder contains a carbon copy of all messages that you
      sent out. (This should point to the "Sent Items" folder on the Exchange
      server)
    </Para>
  </ListItem>

  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    postponed-folder -- This folder contains postponed messages, that you wish
      to finish later. (If you are using Outlook, this should point to the
      "Drafts" folder on the Exchange server, otherwise you can create your own
      on the server)
    </Para>
  </ListItem>

  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    ldap-server -- This is the hostname of your LDAP server. There are many
      parameters available for which you should consult your Pine documentation.
      (This will be used to access the Global Address List on the Exchange
      Server).
    </Para>
  </ListItem>

  <ListItem>
    <Para>
    rsh-open-timeout -- Pine will use rsh to connect to IMAP by default.
      This is an Integer value which represents the timeout period. (Since
      Exchange servers don't run rsh, we are going to want to disable this
      feature by setting this value to 0).
    </Para>
  </ListItem>
</ItemizedList>

</Para>

<Para>
One potential problem that you may run into is SMTP Authentication. Basically,
this means that you need to provide a username and password to use SMTP to send
email. I have found no official documentation which states that Pine supports
SMTP Authentication (more so on the contrary). The closest thing I've found is
the possibility of a /user Parameter to the smtp-server setting, which was
mentioned briefly in the change log from version 4.20 to 4.21. It was also
brought up a couple of times on the listserv. (see Resources)
</Para>

<Para>
If you still have problems with it, here is an alternative which I ended up
using. You can have your SysAdmin add your IP address to the Exchange
Server to allow you to bypass the SMTP authentication.
</Para>

</Sect1>

<Sect1 id="example">
<Title>Example Configuration</Title>

<para>
This example should help carify the syntax of the settings defined in the
previous section, with a set of artificial data.
</para>

<Sect2>
<Title>Gather your information</Title>

<para>
Let us assume the following default information (You may provide your own
if you have it available):
</para>

<para>
<Screen>
  Printed Name = "Foo Foo"
  Account/User Name = "foofoo"
  Domain Name = "foofoo.org"
  Exchange/IMAP/LDAP Server = "192.168.1.25"
</Screen>
</para>

<para>
NOTE: In order for the transition to be seamless, you have to make sure you
match the information precisely as it is stored on the Exchange Server. (ie
if your name on the Exchange server is "John B. Doe", make sure you set your
printed name to the exact value)
</para>

<para>
Let us also assume, you have been using Outlook up to this point, and you have
accumulated some messages in your "INBOX", "Sent Items", and "Drafts". Not too
mention a couple of personal folders you created in your "INBOX" on the server
to categorize your mail: "TODO", "DONE", and "Personal".
</para>
</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Setting up a local ~/.pinerc configuration file</Title>

<para>
Here are the settings you should find in your ~/.pinerc file. In most cases, each
setting will be empty (ie "key=" with no value specified). Here is what they
would look like plugging in the default information.
</para>

<para>
<Screen>
  user-domain=foofoo.org
  smtp-server=192.168.1.25
  inbox-path={192.168.1.25/user=foofoo}INBOX
  folder-collections="INBOX Folders" {192.168.1.25/user=foofoo}inbox/[],
                     "Mailbox Folders" {192.168.1.25/user=foofoo}[]
  default-fcc="{192.168.1.25/user=foofoo}Sent Items"
  postponed-folder={192.168.1.25/user=foofoo}Drafts
  customized-hdrs=From: Foo Foo &#60;foofoo@foofoo.org&#62;
  ldap-servers=192.168.1.100 "/base=/impl=1/rhs=0/ref=0/nosub=0/type=
             /srch=contains/time=/size=/cust=/nick=/matr=/catr=/satr=/gatr="
  rsh-open-timeout=0
</Screen>
</para>

<para>
NOTE: If you want to try SMTP Authentication with the above configuration, you
would replace:

<screen>
smtp-server=192.168.1.25
</screen>

with:

<screen>
smtp-server=192.168.1.25/user=foofoo
</screen>

</para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Setting up a site-wide Pine configuration</Title>

<para>
This configuration affects all the users on the system and requires a bit more
work to setup. Only a UNIX SysAdmin should attempt this configuration. 
</para>

<para>
NOTE: In order for this configuration to work properly, the Microsoft domain
account information must be synced up with the Unix account information
(ie. usernames and full names must match).
</para>

<para>
Looking at the default provided information you should notice that "Printed Name",
and "Account/User Name" now have to be generalized. For "Printed Name", in
removing it from the configuration file, Pine will default to the personal name
found in the /etc/passwd file. For "Account/User Name", you can use "${USER}",
which points to the environment variable which holds the users login name. So
with that you get the following configuration:
</para>

<para>
<Screen>
  user-domain=foofoo.org
  smtp-server=192.168.1.25
  inbox-path={192.168.1.25/user=${USER}}INBOX
  folder-collections="INBOX Folders" {192.168.1.25/user=${USER}}inbox/[],
                     "Mailbox Folders" {192.168.1.25/user=${USER}}[]
  default-fcc="{192.168.1.25/user=${USER}}Sent Items"
  postponed-folder={192.168.1.25/user=${USER}}Drafts
  #customized-hdrs=From: Foo Foo &#60;foofoo@foofoo.org&#62;
  ldap-servers=192.168.1.100 "/base=/impl=1/rhs=0/ref=0/nosub=0/type=
             /srch=contains/time=/size=/cust=/nick=/matr=/catr=/satr=/gatr="
  rsh-open-timeout=0
</Screen>
</para>

<para>
NOTE: In this configuration we want to comment out the "customized-hdrs" setting
since we want the user information to be retrieved from the system /etc/passwd
file.
</para>

<para>
The last step in this configuration is determining whether to put the settings
in /etc/pine.conf or /etc/pine.conf.fixed. That choice is yours, and depends
on how much control you need to give to the users. If your company only
uses Exchange, maybe all the settings should go in fixed, but then users couldn't
use Pine for anything else. Remember, if you put a setting in pine.conf.fixed,
the user does not have the option to change it.
</para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Logging into the Exchange/IMAP server</Title>

<para>
When you first start up Pine, with your new configuration file (You can use the
command 'pine -p .pinerc.new-config' if you have multiple), Pine will
automatically try to connect to your Exchange/IMAP Server. After establishing a
connection, using the provided username from the configuration file, it will
prompt you for your password. This will be your network logon password on the
Microsoft domain. Once you get authenticated, you should be ready to go.
</para>
</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Accessing your Folders with IMAP</Title>

<para>
When you first open your folder list, you should see three folder collections.
Incoming Folders(INBOX), INBOX Folders(personal folders), and Mailbox Folders
specialized folders).
</para>

<para>
Even though this is not a Pine HOWTO, there is one thing I want to point out
about navigating the folders. When viewing the contents of a folder, if you want
to view the list of messages in the folder, hit the "ENTER" key, if you want to
view the list of folders(subdirectories) in the folder, hit the ">" key. If you
need more information on using Pine, check out their website (see Resources).
</para>
</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Accessing your Global Address List with LDAP</Title>

<para>
Using the default configuration provided in this example, when you compose a
new message, and type in a name in the "To:" box. Pine will first check your
local addressbook for the nickname. If it doesn't find it, it will then run an
LDAP query by default, using the default name you typed as the search string.
Depending on the speed of the LDAP server, you should get a response
relatively quickly. From the results you can choose the entry you were looking
for, and continue writing your email.
</para>

<para>
NOTE: If you type in an email address in the "To:" box, it will NOT do an LDAP
search or any other addressbook search (ie. user@smtp.email.org).
</para>

<para>
If you just want to do a search, without actually composing a new message, you
can go directly to your addressbook, select the LDAP server, and type the
search string from there (ie (M)ain, (A)ddressbook).
</para>

<para>
In case you do not want Pine to do an automatic LDAP lookup everytime you
compose a new message, you can change the parameter "/impl=1" in the
"ldap-server" setting to "/impl=0".  This will allow you to do a manual LDAP
query if you wish.
</para>
</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Sending an email with SMTP</Title>

<para>
This procedure does not change from normal Pine usage. You can start composing
your message right away. When you send the message it will get sent through the
provided SMTP server.
</para>
