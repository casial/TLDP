<para>
This HOWTO is a by-product of many years of experience setting up and
managing Usenet news servers. We have learned a lot from those who have
trod the path ahead of us. Some of them include the team of the ERNET
Project (Educational and Research Network), which brought the Internet
technology to India's academic institutions in the early
nineties. We specially remember what we have learned from the
<emphasis>SIGSys</emphasis> Group of the Department of Computer Science
of the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai. We have also benefited
enormously from the guidance we received from the Networking Group at
the NCST (National Centre for Software Technology) in Mumbai, specially
from Geetanjali Sampemane.  </para>

<para>On a wider scale, our learning along the path of systems and
networks started with Unix, without which our appreciation of computer
systems would have remained very fragmented and superficial. Our insight
into Unix came from our ``Village Elders'' in the Department of Computer
Science of the IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) at Mumbai, specially
from ``Hattu,'' ``Sathe,'' and ``Sapre,'' none of whom are with the IIT
today, and from Professor D. B. Phatak and others, many of whom, luckily
are still with the Institute.</para>

<para>Coming to Starcom, all the members of Starcom Software who
have worked on various problems with networking, Linux, and Usenet news
installations have helped the authors in understanding what works and
what doesn't. Without their work, this HOWTO would have been a dry text
book.</para>

<para>Hema Kariyappa co-authored the first couple of versions of this
HOWTO, starting with v2.0.</para>
