<para>
With disk space becoming less expensive (100GB Western Digital 7200rpm available
for US $195 in January 2002), it is viable to use an Open Source 
software-based CD Server solution, instead of paying 
$800-$4,000 for a software, thin-server, or CD Jukebox solution.

I've setup my CD Server on a Pentium 200 with 64MB RAM, using one of these 
large drives.

Previous to the 2.4 kernels, the Linux-Mandrake distribution I was using only had
support for 8 loop devices compiled into the kernel (see 
<xref linkend="addloops" /> 
to increase this number).
At that time, you were only be able to share 8 CD's on a network 
with that default value, and to share more than 8, the loop block driver source code (loop.c) needed
to be modified and a new kernel compiled.
</para>
<para><emphasis>With the 2.4 kernels, that is no longer required.</emphasis>
You can now set the number of loop
devices dynamically via the max_loop module parameter, or by passing max_loop=[1-255] 
to the kernel on boot.

Choose (or create) a file system with the largest available disk
space on it.  Keep in mind that CD-ROM's can hold around 640MB of data,
so if you want to share 8 full CD's on your network,
you'll need 5.1GB of space available.

SCSI CD-ROM's) I'll use the Mandrake distribution CD-ROM as an Example:

Now that we've manually mounted the image, and made sure it works, 
an entry needs to made in the <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> file so that the image is 
remounted on the next system startup.  It's important to make the 
entry AFTER the entry for the parent filesystem, e.g. 
<filename class="directory">/home</filename> (I use <command>vim</command>, 
but <command>emacs</command>, <command>joe</command>, <command>pico</command>

<para>
You'll need to have Samba installed and working to perform the next 
steps (that's outside the scope of this instruction, see <xref linkend="reading" />).  If it's not 
yet installed, consult your Linux distribution's instructions for 
installing the Samba package.  Or you can visit the Samba website 
at <ulink url="http://us1.samba.org/samba/samba.html">http://us1.samba.org/samba/samba.html</ulink> 
	for installation instructions, 
binaries, and/or the source code.
</para>

<para>
To share your mounted CD's on a windows network, simply create 
a stanza in the <filename>/etc/smb.conf</filename> file similar to the following:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
[cdimages]
  comment = All Shared CD Images
  path = /mnt/iso
  public = yes
  writable = no
</screen>
</para>

<para>
	This will share all the subdirectories under the 
	<filename class="directory">/mnt/iso</filename> directory 
on the network.  To mount the share to a local drive (in this case 
the I: drive), bring up an MS-DOS Prompt on the Windows machine and 
type the following:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
<prompt>C:\&#62;</prompt> <command>net use I: \\yourlinuxmachine\cdimages</command>
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Each CD image will now appear as a subdirectory on the I: drive of 
your Windows machine.
</para>

<para>
To mount ONLY the Mandrake CD image to a drive letter (we'll use M:, 
the root drive of which, will correspond exactly to the CD as if it 
was just inserted in the CD-ROM drive), create the following stanza 
in the <filename>/etc/smb.conf</filename> file.
</para>

<para>
<screen>
[mndrk81]
  comment = Mandrake Linux 8.1
  path = /mnt/iso/mndrk81
  public = yes
  writable = no
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Then, at your MS-DOS Prompt, mount it with the following command:
</para>

<para>

    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.

    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent

    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</para>

    <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</para>

    <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</para>

    <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</para>

    <title>MODIFICATIONS</title>

    <para>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the
    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,
    you must do these things in the Modified Version:</para>

    <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">
      <listitem><para>Use in the Title Page

      may omit a network location for a work that was published at
      least four years before the Document itself, or if the original

    </orderedlist>
    
    <para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</para>

    <para>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</para>

    <para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</para>

    <para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>

  <sect1 label="5" id="gfdl-5">
    <title>COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>

    <para>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</para>

    <para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</para>

    <para>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</para>

  <sect1 label="6" id="gfdl-6">
    <title>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>

    <para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
    other documents released under this License, and replace the
    individual copies of this License in the various documents with a
    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
    the documents in all other respects.</para>

    <para>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
    copying of that document.</para>

  <sect1 label="7" id="gfdl-7">
    <title>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>
    
    <para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</para>

    <para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
    aggregate.</para>

  <sect1 label="8" id="gfdl-8">
    <title>TRANSLATION</title>

    <para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of
    a disagreement between the translation and the original English
    version of this License, the original English version will
    prevail.</para>

    <title>TERMINATION</title>
    
    <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any
    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full

    <title>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>

    <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised

    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present

    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.</para>

    <title>How to use this License for your documents</title>

    <para>To use this License in a document you have written, include
    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</para>

<blockquote><para>
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1

      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".
</para></blockquote>

    <para>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
    Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have
    no Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover
    Texts.</para>

    <para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
