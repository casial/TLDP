I can only wish you luck and hope that you, like me, will be happy recovering data. </para></section></section><section><title>Technical info</title><section><title>Disks</title><para>A hard disk is made of sectors numbered from 0 to the max. </para><para>dmesg gives, for example: </para><screen><![CDATA[hdb: ST34321A, 4103MB w/128kB Cache, CHS=523/255/63]]></screen><para>CHS means Cylinders, Heads, Sectors. </para><para>523*255*63=8401995 sectors of 512 bytes, thus the 4103 MB. This is only a logical map; it's not necessarily what is written on the disk cover (except for the total size). </para><para>The true size of the sectors is of no interest for us, given that we don't want to modify anything, but merely wish to restore a previous state. For us, the default size given by fdisk is all right. </para><para>The size seen by the system is directly dependent on the work of the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System - the PC's ROM). The mode of the hard disk indicated in the BIOS is essential. On a new disk, it's better to use BIOS automatic hard disk recognition and say "yes". Anyway, any modification at this level may destroy all the data of the disk, so don't play with this without essential reason. </para><para>This is probably what your disk already uses, so don't be afraid. </para></section><section><title>Partitions</title><para>Disk are now huge -- 500 GB drives are not rare -- so it's not really handy to have all this stuff packed in only one part. Only MS Windows does so, and, if you use Linux, maybe it's because you are aware of how inefficient the other is. </para><para>So a hard disk is usually cut in some pieces called "partitions" (see the <ulink url='http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Partition/index.html'>Partition HOWTO</ulink> for details, also read <emphasis>README.fdisk</emphasis> on the web or on your disk - location vary). </para><para>Let's get a look at (part of) my own print of <command>fdisk -l</command> : </para><screen><![CDATA[Disk /dev/hdb: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 523 cylinders

Of course, numbers are bigger. </para></section><section><title>Why is there a problem?</title><para>The problem is that all installed operating systems must share the disks, and, since at start, the BIOS only scans the first one, there must be a so called "partition table" at the very beginning of this disk. This partition table is located in the Master Boot Record (MBR), side by side with the boot loader. </para><para>Any misuse of the MBR by any of the OS's leads to problems. When trying to install any system, a "yes" answer at a question like "automatic partitioning?" is likely to give problems... This is specially true with MS Windows, and especially with custom MS Windows installations made by special makes' PCs (when no true "Windows" CD is included, as with many laptops). But it's also true with some "smart" (not so smart!) Linux installation programs included with some distributions (hopefully this is not more the case in 2008). </para></section></section><section><title>Solving the problem</title><para>Please, beware!

In my opinion, using sector limit is a very bad idea, but it may have a real use I'm not aware of. The problem is that, with cylinder limit, it's easy to guess even if you don't have paper. With sector one, there are many more guesses... </para><para>fdisk is a small and very smart programs. There are many other makes of fdisk, but I always prefer the bare bones one. (I speak of Linux ones, of course, not the others....) </para><para>Be aware that fdisk doesn't write anything to disk before you hit w and return.

It's possible you might not be able to do that as usual: lilo/grub may have been damaged also, and you thus may need a boot floppy or CD.

Right now, I'm not sure that the same thing is as easy with GRUB, but it should not be very difficult, either. </para><para>Your Linux should be all here; test it. Try, also, to start MS Windows if applicable. If you can't, there is a (very small) chance you can read your data from Linux, maybe with a raw sector-by-sector read. If you can identify the disk sectors your data is on, using dd you can copy it to a file. This is wise for text only.

There is still a chance you don't have any data there or the data is unimportant, but, the less often you do such tries, the better. </para><para>First, be aware that as soon as you don't write to the disk (except with fdisk), you don't erase your data, so that you can use a block-by-block try.
