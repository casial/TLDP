         This document provides a checklist for steps you should take
         immediately after installing GNU/Linux. These steps will save you
         a lot of bother if you encounter any problems later on. This
         document also includes a shell script for automating the post
         installation process.

<!-- SECTION 1.0 INTRO -->

<sect1 id="intro"><title>Introduction</title>

   <para>
     You have just completed installing your own Linux system. You
     have just made an upgrade to your existing Linux system. You are
     happy with the first few checkouts and usage experience.  You
     want to make sure you will enjoy this system in spite of any
     damage which may occur later because of any unexpected &quot;faux
     pas&quot;.
   </para>

   <para>
     It is a good idea to keep a snapshot of the new system, so that
     you can be assured that in the event of any misfortune with your
     Linux installation, you can always recover without any permanent
     damage. This checklist will help you with precautionary steps
     you must take, as soon as you complete installation of Linux. It
     is a sequel to the <ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/Pre-Installation-Checklist/">GNU/Linux 
     pre-installation checklist</ulink>, and a companion to the official
     <ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO/">Linux Installation HOWTO</ulink>.
     This checklist also contains a <xref linkend="shellscript"> which will 
     automate the process of making a snapshot of your system.

<sect1 id="steps"><title>Post-Installation Steps</title>

<para>
To enjoy your new Linux installation forever without any worries, it is
important to take a few simple precautions. You must do these as soon
as you complete installing Linux on your machine for the first time.
</para>

<orderedlist numeration="arabic">

<listitem><para>Create a
<ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Bootdisk-HOWTO/">boot 
diskette</ulink> and a <emphasis>rescue diskette</emphasis>. 
Utilities for creating these diskettes are available along with
your Linux distribution.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If you are the paranoid type (like me), you
can make two copies of each of these diskettes. Diskettes are
notorious for failing when they are most needed.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis>Test out your boot diskette</emphasis>.
Make sure you can boot into Linux using the boot diskette. Remember
Murphy's Laws may strike at you just when you least expect.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Checkout thoroughly your new system. Try all major packages.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Try out the X windows system, and the desktop, and
the windows manager, if you have installed these.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Try out the connection to your LAN, and to the Internet.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Create at least one &quot;non-root&quot; account, for
testing and debugging your installation. Perform ALL the above
checkouts once again, using the non-root account you created.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Join a local Linux Users Group (LUG). You must
<ulink url="http://www.linuxlinks.com/UserGroups/">
find out if there is a LUG close by</ulink>. If there is none, start an
informal LUG yourself, in your neighbourhood, your campus, your city,
or your town.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Join one or more 
<ulink url="http://oslab.snu.ac.kr/~djshin/linux/mail-list/index.shtml">mailing
lists for Linux</ulink> updates and news. There are literally hundreds of
them.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Register yourself and your machine in the worldwide
<ulink url="http://counter.li.org/">Linux Users Counter</ulink>.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis>And finally...</emphasis>Download the 
<xref linkend="shellscript"> and run it. Make a safe copy (on a removable
medium) of the directory:  <filename>/root/postinfo</filename> which
the script will create. You may also like to make a printout of the
summary report <filename>/root/postinfo/summary</filename> created by
the shell script.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>You must run this shell script: as soon as you have
installed Linux for the first time, and after every major revision or
upgrade to your Linux system. You can also set up the script as a
cron job, so that it runs itself periodically and automatically. This
will avoid you a lost of hassles later, in case something gets messed
up later.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="shellscript"><title>Shell script</title>

<para>
The shell script (shivalik Ver. 1.0) is a convenient way to make
backups of essential files and information. After downloading the
script:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Make sure that you have logged in as &quot;root&quot;
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Save the script in a directory with &quot;root&quot; permissions, 
say <filename>/root/myscript</filename> 
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Change to that directory i.e. <command>cd /root/myscript</command>
use gunzip to unzip the script i.e <command>gunzip ./shivalik.gz</command>
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
<note><title>IMPORTANT</title><para>
You must read the warning given at the end of the
script. Proceed with the next steps, only if you agree to the
conditions specified in the warning...
</para></note>
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
To execute the script: You must make the script executable (by root
only) <command>chmod 700 ./shivalik</command>
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Verify that the paths of the various files which are to be saved, are
correct and conform to your installation.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
You can execute the script correctly only if you are &quot;root&quot; (many
of the files being saved need root permissions).
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
     Now you can execute (run) the above script (remember you must be
     &quot;root&quot;, to do this) -- type <command>./shivalik</command>
</para>

<para>
     The script is profusely documented. It does not modify (or
     delete) any of your files or directories. It creates a
     well-protected backup of some essential files and information.
     The entire script is available for you to browse and understand
     its working. Feel free to go through the script and add any
     additional features, or files which you wish to be backed up.
     You may also send your feedback to the author of this
     script (<email>algolog@hd1.vsnl.net.in</email>).
</para>

<para>
     Remember, the <command>shivalik</command> script is not a tool
     for complete backup and recovery. Ideally, the best thing to do
     would be to make a verbatim copy of your entire Linux
     installation along with all files and directories. This is not
     always possible, necessary, or advisable. The next best thing
     would be to take a backup of the most essential information and
     files. The <command>shivalik</command> script achieves this for
     you. The script creates a directory called
     <filename>/root/postinfo/</filename>, and stores all essential
     information (and files) there. To be absolutely prepared for any
     eventuality, you must copy the entire
     <filename>/root/postinfo/</filename> on a removable medium, as
     soon as the script is executed.
</para>

<para><emphasis>Recovery and Repair:</emphasis> In the
     event of any problems later, you can reconstruct the
     damaged files by copying the files you have backed up in the
     <filename>/root/postinfo/</filename> directory. It is as simple
     as that.
</para>

<para>
     The structure of the <filename>/root/postinfo/</filename> directory,
     and files found within, will be as follows:
</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term><filename>/root/postinfo/summary</filename></term>
<listitem><para>
Contains a summary report of the status of your system (memory,
partitions, mount points, disk usage). This file also has the list of
files which have been saved. It also contains admin info like date
and time of backup, shivalik version number etc.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><filename>/root/postinfo/postinfo.tar.gz</filename></term>
<listitem><para>
Contains a copy of the earlier postinfo (if any).  This is a fall
back to a fall back!
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><filename>/root/postinfo/snapshot.gz</filename></term>
<listitem><para>
Contains a gzipped structured listing of <emphasis>ALL</emphasis>
files and directories of your Linux system (the directories "tree").
You can unzip this file and use any plain text editor to know the
location of any file. Of course, you cannot retrieve the contents of
that file unless you had saved it explicitly elsewhere.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><filename>/root/postinfo/shivalik</filename></term>
<listitem><para>
This is a copy of the shivalik script which was used for making the
post install backup. At the time of recovery after an incident, you
can always examine this script to know how the backup was done
earlier. You will always have a consistent copy of the script and the
files created by the script.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><filename>/root/postinfo/etcfiles/</filename></term>
<listitem><para>
This <emphasis>subdirectory</emphasis> contains a copy of many
essential files from the <filename>/etc/</filename> directory of your
Linux installation. It also contains copies of the various
configuration files stored in the <filename>/etc/</filename>
directory.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><filename>/root/postinfo/otherfiles/</filename></term>
<listitem><para>
This <emphasis>subdirectory</emphasis> contains a copy of some
essential files (those which are not in the
<filename>/etc/</filename> directory) of your Linux installation. If
you want, you can add any other files here, and get it saved
automatically with others.
</para></listitem>
