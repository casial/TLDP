<abstract>
<para>This document describes how to setup an ethernet bridge.  What
is an ethernet bridge? An ethernet bridge is a device that controls data
packets within a subnet in an attempt to cut down the amount of traffic.  
A bridge is usually placed between two separate groups of computers that
talk within themselves, but not so much with the computers in the other
group.  A good example of this is to consider a cluster of Macintoshes and
a cluster of unix machines.  Both of these groups of machines tend to be
quite chatty amongst themselves, and the traffic they produce on the
network causes collisions for the other machines who are trying to speak
to one another.  A bridge would be placed between these groups of
computers.  The job of the bridge is then to examine the destination of
the data packets one at a time and decide whether or not to pass the
packets to the other side of the ethernet segment.  The result is a
faster, quieter network with less collisions.

  <listitem>
    <para>Enable multiple ethernet devices on your machine by

        <screen>append = "ether=0,0,eth1"</screen>

    <para>If you have three interfaces on your bridge, use this line instead:

    </para>
    <para>More interfaces can be found by adding more ether statements.
        By default a stock Linux kernel probes for a single ethercard,
        and once one is found the probe ceases.  The above append statement 
        tells the kernel to keep probing for more ethernet devices after the 
        first one is found.
        Alternatively, the boot parameter can be used instead:
        <screen>linux ether=0,0,eth1</screen>
    </para>

    <para>A bridge should not have an IP address.
        It CAN, but a plain bridge doesn't need one.
        To remove the IP address from your bridge, go to
        <filename>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/</filename> (for a RedHat system)
        and copy <filename>ifcfg-lo0</filename> to <filename>ifcfg-eth0</filename> &amp;
        <filename>ifcfg-eth1</filename>.
        In these two new files, change the line containing
        <userinput>DEVICE=lo</userinput> to <userinput>DEVICE=eth0</userinput>
        and <userinput>DEVICE=eth1</userinput>.
        Since other distributions may deviate from this, you may need to refer to additional
        documentation.
        If there are more than 2 interfaces to this bridge,
        be sure to make the corresponding configurations to those, as well.

    <para>Once the system is backed up, put the ethernet cards into promiscuous mode,

        All interfaces which are connected to network segments to be bridged
        are to be put into promiscuous mode.

        <para>I cannot <application>telnet</application>/<application>ftp</application> from the bridge! Why?</para>
      </question> 
      <answer>
        <para>This is because there is no IP address bound to any of bridge
        interfaces.  A bridge is to be a transparent part of a network.</para>
     </answer>
     </qandaentry>

     <qandaentry>
     <question>
	<para>What do I need to set up in the way of routing?</para>
     </question>	
     <answer>
        <para>Nothing!
        All routing intelligence is handled by
        the bridging code in the kernel.
        To see the ethernet addresses as they are learned by the bridge,
        use the <application>brcfg</application> program in debug mode:</para>
        <screen>
brcfg -deb
        </screen>
     </answer>
     </qandaentry>

     <qandaentry>
     <question>
        <para>The bridge appears to work, but why doesn't <application>traceroute</application> show the bridge as a part of the path?</para>
     </question>
     <answer>
        <para>Due to the nature of a bridge, a <application>traceroute</application> should NOT show the bridge as a part of the path. A bridge is to be a transparent component of the network.</para>
     </answer>
     </qandaentry>

     <qandaentry>
     <question>
        <para>Is it necessary to compile <envar>IP_FORWARD</envar> into the kernel?</para>
     </question>
     <answer>
        <para>No. The bridging code in the kernel takes care of the packet
        transport.
        <envar>IP_FORWARD</envar> is for a gateway that has IP addresses
        bound to its interfaces.</para>
     </answer>
     </qandaentry>

     <qandaentry>
     <question>
        <para>Why are the physical ethernet addresses for port 1 and port 2 the
        same according to the <application>brcfg</application> program?
        Shouldn't they be different?</para>
     </question> 
     <answer>
        <para>No. Every port on a bridge intentionally is assigned the same
        physical ethernet address by the bridging code.</para>
     </answer>
     </qandaentry>

     <qandaentry>
     <question>
        <para>Bridging does not appear to be an option when performing a make
        config on the kernel.  How does one enable it?</para>
     </question>
     <answer>
        <para>During the kernel config, answer <quote>Y</quote> to the question, <prompt>Prompt for
        development and/or incomplete code/drivers (CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL) [Y/n/?]</prompt>.</para>
     </answer>
     </qandaentry>

     <qandaentry>
     <question>
        <para>Too many hubs (4 or more) are chained one after another in series, 
        cause timing problems on an ethernet.  What effect does a bridge
        have in a subnet that is layered with hubs?</para>
     </question>
     <answer>
        <para>A bridge resets the 3/4/5 hubs rule.  A bridge does not deal with
        packets the way a hub does, and is therefore not a contributor to
        timing problems on a network.</para>
     </answer>
     </qandaentry>

     <qandaentry>
     <question>
        <para>Can a bridge interface to both 10Mb and 100Mb ethernet segments?
        Will such a configuration slow down the rest of the traffic on the
        high speed side?</para>
     </question>
     <answer>
        <para>Yes, a bridge can tie together a 10Mb segment with a 100Mb segment.
        As long as the network card on the fast network is 100Mb capable,
        TCP takes care of the rest.  While it's true that the
        packets from a host in the 100Mb network communicating to a host
        in the 10Mb network are moving at only 10Mb/s, the rest of the
        traffic on the fast ethernet is not slowed down.</para>

<title>PREAMBLE</title>

<para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
    or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
    author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
    being considered responsible for modifications made by
    others.</para>

<para>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the
    same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which
    is a copyleft license designed for free software.</para>

<para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
    for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
    a free program should come with manuals providing the same
    freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited
    to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
    regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
    printed book.  We recommend this License principally for works
    whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>

<title>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>

<para>This License applies to any manual or other work that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document",
    below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the
    public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</para>

<para>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</para>

<para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</para>

<para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

<para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

<para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

<para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</para>

<para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
    "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
    text.</para>

<title>VERBATIM COPYING</title>

<para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</para>

<para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
    above, and you may publicly display copies.</para>

<sect2 id="gfdl-3">
<title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>

<para>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</para>

<para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</para>

<para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</para>

<para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the

    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</para>

<para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>

<sect2 id="gfdl-5">
<title>COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>

<para>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</para>

<para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</para>

<para>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="gfdl-6">
<title>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>

<para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
    other documents released under this License, and replace the
    individual copies of this License in the various documents with a
    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
    the documents in all other respects.</para>

<para>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
    copying of that document.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="gfdl-7">
<title>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>
<para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</para>

<para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
    aggregate.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="gfdl-8">
<title>TRANSLATION</title>

<para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of
    a disagreement between the translation and the original English
    version of this License, the original English version will
    prevail.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="gfdl-9">
<title>TERMINATION</title>
<para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any
    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="gfdl-10">
<title>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>

<para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
    versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
    version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
    concerns.  See <ulink
    url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</ulink>.</para>

<para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="gfdl-11">
<title>How to use this License for your documents</title>

<para>To use this License in a document you have written, include
    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</para>

<blockquote><para>
Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".
</para></blockquote>

<para>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
    Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have
    no Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover
    Texts.</para>

<para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
    code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
    choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
    License, to permit their use in free software.</para>
