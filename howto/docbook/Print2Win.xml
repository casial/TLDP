    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      As we want the print service running, we'll set up all the
      environment step by step, to avoid mistakes or bad configurations.
    </para>

    <para>
      First, set up the server; when you have the server running, configure
      the clients.
    </para>

  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Server (Windows)</title>
    <para>      
      There is no special rules when configuring the server. Just install the
      printer driver in the Windows server, test it to verify that the printer
      is running properly, and share the printer.
    </para>

  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Client (Linux)</title>
    <para>
      The client configuration is similar to Linux to Linux printing.
    </para>

    <section>
      <title>Standard lpr</title>
      <para>
        The simplest way to do it is to add an entry to
        <filename>/etc/printcap</filename>.  As a quick example, the entry
        for a generic matrix printer would be:
<screen># EPSON LX300 
epson:\
:sd=/var/spool/lpd/epson:\
:mx#0:\
:sh:\
:if=/var/spool/lpd/epson/filter:\
:lp=/dev/null:</screen>
      </para>

      <note>
        <para>
          Make sure you are using the correct filter, or the right generic
          one.
        </para>
      </note>


      <para>
        Be sure you have created the directory
        <filename>/var/spool/lpd/epson</filename>, and the users you wish
        to use the printer have the right access to this.
      </para>

      <para>
        For example, assume the Windows print server is named <systemitem
        class="systemname">meriadoc</systemitem>, with an <acronym
        role="protocol">IP</acronym> address of
        <literal>192.168.1.49</literal>, and the printer is shared from
        Windows as <systemitem class="systemname">epsonLX</systemitem>.
      </para>
      <para>
        So, you have to configure
        <filename>/var/spool/lpd/epson/.config</filename> like this:
<screen>share='\\meriadoc\epsonLX'
hostip=192.168.1.49</screen>
      </para>
      <para>
        Where:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><varname>share</varname>='\\<replaceable>windows-print-server-name</replaceable>\<replaceable>print-share-name</replaceable>'</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><varname>hostip</varname>=<replaceable>windows-print-server-IP</replaceable></para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

      </para>
      <para>
        Once your <filename>/etc/printcap</filename> is configured, you
        have to enable the print share:
<screen><prompt>[localhost]$</prompt> <userinput>lpc up epson</userinput>
<prompt>[localhost]$</prompt> <userinput>lpc enable epson</userinput></screen>
      </para>
      <para>
        If everything is ok, you can send jobs to the queue:

<screen><prompt>[localhost]$</prompt> <userinput>lpr -Pepson <replaceable>file</replaceable></userinput></screen>
      </para>

    </section>

  <section>
    <title><filename>/etc/printcap</filename> Tips</title>
    <para>
      I have used the entry below in the first example, but this is not a
      particularly good idea:
<screen>...
:lp=/dev/null:\</screen>
    </para>
    <para>
      Because lpr does an <quote>exclusive</quote> open on the file you specify as lp=.
      It does this in order to prevent multiple processes from trying to
      print to the same printer at the same time.
    </para>
    <para>
      The side effect of this is that in your case, <literal>eng</literal>
      and <literal>colour</literal> can't print at the same time, (usually more
      or less transparent since they probably print quickly and since they queue
      you probably don't notice) but any other process that tries to write to
      <filename>/dev/null</filename> will break!
    </para>
    <para>
      On a single user system, probably not a big problem. I have a system with
      over 50 printers. It would be a problem there.
    </para>
    <para>
      The solution is to create a dummy printer for each. Eg:
      <userinput>touch /dev/eng</userinput>.
    </para>
    <para>
<screen><prompt>[localhost]$</prompt> <userinput>touch /dev/eng</userinput>
<prompt>[localhost]$</prompt> <userinput>touch /dev/colour</userinput></screen>
    </para>
