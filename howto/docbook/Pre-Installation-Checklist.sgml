        	<para>
        	Are you a Linux newbie ? Are you a Linux guru ? In both cases, you will find
                this checklist of great help to you. How many times have you found yourself
                fumbling in the middle of a Linux installation process, because some vital
                information about the target hardware is not known ?
               	</para>

        	<para>
        	Have you ever crossed your fingers when you were asked by the installation
                procedure, a simple question, like: to which COM port is the mouse
                connected ?
        	</para>

                <para>
                Let's face it, all of us have, at one time or another, felt we should have
                been better prepared before starting to install Linux. Here is a simple
                solution, brought to you by Algologic Research & Solutions
                </para>

<!-- SECTION 1.5 AUDIENCE -->

<sect2 id="audience"><title>Who should read/use this?</title>

	<para>
        If you are planning to install Linux on somebody else's machine, or
        in a location which is not your own work place, you must absolutely get
        this checklist completed in advance. It is important to get this
        questionnaire answered by your host, so that you go adequately prepared
        for the installation.
        </para>

        <para>
        If you are planning to organize an "Install fest" (we Indians
        call it "Linux mela"), ask your participants to come with this
        checklist answered.
        </para>

        <para>
        Conversely, if you are going to an Install fest (aka Linux mela), to get
        Linux installed on your machine, do your home-work. Go with answers to
        this checklist.
        </para>

        <para>
        If you are going to ask someone to come over and install Linux for
        you, send him/her this questionnaire with as many responses as you know.
        </para>

        <para>
        If you are the D-I-Y type, you must start by answering all these questions,
        so that you can save time for enjoying your Linux!
        </para>

<!-- SECTION 1.6 GOALS -->

<sect2 id="goals"><title>What does this checklist (aim to) achieve?</title>

        <para>
        This is a memory aid which may make installation of Linux a pleasant
        experience for you. It fills an important role in the promotion of Linux.
        </para>

        <para>
        It will help you to be prepared with all the answers which may be needed
        during the course of installation of Linux on your machine or on anybody
        else's machine. Sometimes, it is very inconvenient and even impossible
        to find out some details in the middle of an installation procedure. This
        becomes all the more difficult when you are installing Linux on somebody
        else's machine, and in somebody else's office.
        </para>

        <para>
        This checklist, when filled up, will help you go through your Linux
        documentation and verify in advance whether certain hardware is supported
        by the distribution you are planning to install. It will also help you
        to be prepared with the packages you would need to install, and the
        configuration choices which need to be done.
        </para>

        <para>
        The idea is to reduce the chances of frustrating surprises.
        </para>

        <para>
        This checklist is only for installing Linux on PCs. You may use this
        checklist as a model for other classes of machines (e.g.SUN, Alpha, ...)
        also.
        </para>

<sect1 id="Checklist"><title>Linux pre-installation checklist</title>

<sect2 id="pre-prechecklist"><title>Before you fill out the checklist</title>

        <para>
        Welcome to the world of Linux. Your first step in  installing
        Linux on your PC will begin by answering a few simple
        questions about your hardware.
        </para>

        <para>
        This checklist will make it easy for you and us to go through
        the  installation, painlessly and without  surprises.  Please
        take  your  own  time and fill up  the  following  checklist.
        Wherever   possible,  and  necessary,  we  have  given   some
        suggestions and hints, for your convenience.
        </para>

        <para>
        If you don't know all the details, you should be able to find
        them  in  your  computer's manuals.  Or,  ask  your  hardware
        vendor, or your local hardware "guru."
        </para>

        <para>
        If  you still have problems finding answers, don't  worry  --
        you   can  just  ignore any areas you don't know.  Bring   in
        your   machine  and  ALL manuals you have.  The  installation
        may succeed with some trials and  a lot of luck.
        </para>

        <para>
        Remember,  Linux,  like many other software  products,  is  a
        growing  product.  Some  of your hardware may  still  not  be
        supported  in  the version of Linux which is being installed.
