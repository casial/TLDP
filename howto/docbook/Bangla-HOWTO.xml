      <para> One of the foremost things on many GNU/Linuxers' wishlist is better support for
their vernacular script on their favourite operating system. But Indic scripts are some of the
most difficult in the world to add support for, because of inherent complexities like the
existence of conjuncts (yuktakshars) and non-standard spellings. However, the Free/Libre/Open
Source community is not one that is easily daunted, and this document tries to outline the
process of setting up Bangla support in <acronym>FLOSS</acronym> applications. Moreover, it also
aims to be the "developers' guide" for new developers in the Bangla in GNU/Linux project.

      <title>Purpose of this HOWTO</title>

      <para> This document explains how to setup and develop support for Bangla (or Bengali) in
a GNU/Linux systems. Bangla support in GNU/Linux is by no means complete, but, in modern
GNU/Linux distributions, you may be able to write in Bangla, send emails in Bangla, chat in
Bangla, save with Bangla filenames (<acronym>UTF-8</acronym>....), have some of your graphical
applications localized in Bangla, etc. Moreover, we have targeted to have the
<acronym>GNOME</acronym> core translated into Bangla by August 2003, so that it can be included
in the 2.4 release of GNOME. (Update- GNOME 2.4 is now out with partial support for Bangla)
      </para>

      <para>
        <note>
          <para> However, note that this documents deals with Bangla support in GNU/Linux in
<acronym>GUI</acronym> based applications only - we have no immediate plans for supporting
Bangla on the console. </para>
        </note>
      </para>

      <para>
        <note>
          <para> Also note that the Bangla support that we speak of here is totally Unicode
compliant. We do not support any kind of proprietary/non-standard encoding. </para>
        </note>
      </para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="usersguide">
    <title>Users' Guide</title>

    <para> This part is mainly for the user - it does not go into the intricacies of development
procedures. However, developers planning to work in this field must also read it - so that they
can setup the required develoment environment. </para>

    <sect2 id="locale">
      <title>Setting up the locale for Bengali</title>

      <para>The first job that you have to do is to setup the locale for Bangla. The formal
description of specific set of cultural habits for some country, together with all associated
translations targeted to the same native language, is called the <quote>locale</quote> for this
language or country. This sub-section describes how to setup the <filename>bn_BD</filename>
locale definition file, which is for Bangladeshi Bengali. However, the Indian Bengali definition
file, i.e. <filename>bn_IN</filename>, can be used in the same manner. </para>

      <para>
        <note>
          <para> Remember that this sub-section is not intended to explain how to create a
locale definition file, we will just explain how to <emphasis>use</emphasis> the locale defition
file for Bangladeshi Bengali. </para>
        </note>
      </para>

      <para> The <filename>bn_BD</filename> file should come with the latest glibc package. in
case you have an older glibc, you can download this file from the
<ulink url="http://www.bengalinux.org/downloads/">download</ulink> section of Bengalinux.org.
      </para>

      <para>
        <caution>
          <para> Make sure you have some Unicode encoded Bengali fonts installed on your system.
If you don't have one, check out <link linkend="fonts">fonts section</link>.
          </para>
        </caution>
      </para>

      <para> Now issue the following command as <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>:
      </para>

      <para>
        <prompt>bash$</prompt> 
        <userinput>localedef -f UTF-8 -i bn_BD bn_BD.UTF-8</userinput>
      </para>

      <para> This makes your system ready to be used with bn_BD locale definition. </para>

      <para> Now make sure your X server is ready for Bengali locale. Check the following file
<filename>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/locale.dir</filename> </para>

      <para> It should have the following lines: </para>

      <programlisting>
    en_US.UTF-8/XLC_LOCALE       bn_BD.UTF-8
    en_US.UTF-8/XLC_LOCALE:      bn_BD.UTF-8
      </programlisting>

      <para> Now your system is ready to use bn_BD.UTF-8 locale. For example, I use the
following command to open up an <command>xterm</command> with my own crappy font: </para>

      <para>
        <prompt>bash$</prompt> 
        <userinput>LC_ALL=bn_BD.UTF-8
                xterm -fn"-misc-Probhat-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-iso10646-1" -u8</userinput>
      </para>

      <para> Remember, if you want to use Bengali in any application, you will have to start
that application under an environment where the locale was set to bn_BD.UTF-8, otherwise it
won't work. </para>

        <title>Installing using the rpm package</title>

        <para> If you are a rpm [read: RedHat %#$!@] user, then the easiest way to install the
fonts from <emphasis><acronym>FBFP</acronym></emphasis> is by using the rpm package. The rpm
package can be downloaded from
<ulink url="http://www.bengalinux.org/downloads/freebanglafont-0.2-1.noarch.rpm">
http://www.Bengalinux.org/downloads/freebanglafont-0.2-1.noarch.rpm</ulink> or
<ulink url="http://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=freebangfont">
http://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=freebangfont</ulink>. Just install the rpm package as
you would do for any other rpm package with the command </para>

        <para>
          <prompt>bash$</prompt> 
          <userinput> rpm -ivh freebanglafont-0.2-1.noarch.rpm</userinput>

      <sect3 id="install-tarball">
        <title>Installing using individual font file</title>

        <para> If you cannot or do not want to use the rpm package, there is always the good old
tgz packages. Remember that you should have root privilege when you execute the commands
mentioned here. </para>

        <para> Download the files you want to install from
<ulink url="http://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=freebangfont">
http://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=freebangfont.</ulink>
        </para>

        <para>
          <note>
            <para> Remember that you will find several different tgz packages in
<emphasis>FBFP</emphasis>. Each of them contain different font faces, i.e. they all look
different from one another. </para>
          </note>
        </para>

        <para> Once you have downloaded all the packages you want, extract all the
<filename>*.ttf</filename> file(s). Basically run the following command on each
<filename>*.tgz</filename> or <filename>*.tar.gz</filename> you have downloaded. </para>

        <para>
          <prompt>bash$</prompt> <userinput>tar -zxvf your_font_package.tar.gz</userinput>
        </para>

        <para> This will create a new directory that will contain different files that comes
with the font package. We are only interested about the <filename>*.ttf</filename> files.
        </para>

        <para> Create a new directory where you want to install these fonts. For the rest of
this document, we will assume we are installing the fonts in
<filename class="directory">/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/bengali/</filename> </para>

        <para> Copy the <filename>*.ttf</filename> files we just extracted in to this directory,
and execute the following commands: </para>

        <para>
          <prompt>bash$</prompt> <userinput>cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/bengali</userinput>
        </para>
        <para><prompt>bash$</prompt> <userinput>ttmkfdir</userinput></para>
        <para><prompt>bash$</prompt> <userinput>mkfontdir</userinput></para>

          <userinput>chkfontpath -q -a /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/bengali</userinput>
        </para>

        <para> Now we will add the new directory to <application>fontconfig</application>
configuration. Usually this configuration file is <filename>/etc/fonts/fonts.conf</filename>.
Open this file with you choice of text editor and look for the part that looks somewhat like
shown below </para>

        <programlisting>
  &lt;dir&gt;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1&lt;/dir&gt;
  &lt;dir&gt;/usr/share/fonts&lt;/dir&gt;
  &lt;dir&gt;~/.fonts&lt;/dir&gt;
        </programlisting>

        <para> Add the line
<programlisting>&lt;dir&gt;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/bengali&lt;/dir&gt;</programlisting> so that
now it looks something like this: </para>

        <programlisting>

        <para> After you have saved the file, execute the following command: </para>
        <para><prompt>bash$</prompt> <userinput>fc-cache</userinput></para>
        <para> If you have GNOME print library (
<systemitem class="library">libgnomeprint</systemitem>) installed, then execute the following
commands: </para>

      <para> On your system you are most likely to use a different value for
<option>-symbols</option>option. Let me explain what they mean, then you can decide what should
be the value for your system. My default keyboard layout for X is <literal>us(pc101)</literal>.
If you don't know what is the default you use, check the <filename>XF86Config</filename> file
As the Bengali keyboard layout is defined in the second group we can simply add everything from
<filename>ben</filename> to our keyboard layout. Now you have setup your keyboard with
<literal>us(pc101)</literal> as group one and <literal>ben</literal> as your second group. What
does that mean? Well in simple words: with X you can have different layouts in different groups
and you  can switch between these different layouts. And that is exactly why we added
<quote>group(ctrl_shift_toggle)</quote>. This means we can switch between the two groups by
pressing <keycombo><keycap>ctrl</keycap><keycap>shift</keycap></keycombo> buttons together.
Matter of fact there are other options for the toggle switch. If your XFree86 is new enough, you
will find a file named <filename>group</filename> in the same directory you copied
<filename>ben</filename>. If your system does not have this file do not worry. You can use an
option like <quote>grp:shift_toggle</quote> which will toggle by pressing both shift buttons. In
which case your command becomes: </para>

        <para> Translation is pretty straight forward - you need to edit the

check out which files are untranslated from
<ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gtp/status/gnome-2.4/bn/index.html">
http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gtp/status/gnome-2.2/bn/index.html</ulink>. Download any one
of the untranslated files and open it in an editor that supports Bangla (sorry - vi/emacs won't
work here). I personally use <ulink url="http://www.yudit.org"><application>Yudit</application>

        <para> The first line specifies the filename and the position in which the string in the
second line occurs. The second line contains the actual string that is to be translated and the
third line is the placeholder for the translated string in Bangla. Thus, in a translated file
this set would look like</para>

          <para> Here, I have written the word <foreignphrase><emphasis>bhul</emphasis>

the actual translation, you will need to write the translated strings in Bangla - and not
English. </para>

      <sect3 id="style">
        <title>Style Guide</title>

        <para> While translating, remember not to <emphasis>kill the language</emphasis> ;-). Do
not overdo the translation - do not use <foreignphrase><emphasis>Sadhu Basha</emphasis>
</foreignphrase>. Also, when the computer is addressing the user, it is
<foreignphrase><emphasis>samman-shuchak (karun, balun, etc)</emphasis></foreignphrase> while the
computer is addressed by <foreignphrase><emphasis>karo, balo, etc</emphasis></foreignphrase>.
If a Bangla equivalent sounds too out of the ordinary - keep the English word (in Bangla script)
- it can be always changed/improved later. <emphasis>DO NOT</emphasis> overdo anything. </para>

        <para>Also, keep proper nouns and trademarks/brandnames as they are.
(<application>Bourne Again Shell (BASH)</application> should not be called <foreignphrase>Aabaar
Bourne Shell</foreignphrase>). </para>

        <para> Use the more common word (<foreignphrase><emphasis>jaanlaa</emphasis>
</foreignphrase> and not <foreignphrase><emphasis>gabaakhya</emphasis></foreignphrase>). Also
always remember that the words need not be very much applicable to the actual action - an
Englishman from the nineteenth century could not even have guessed what <quote>Save</quote> can
do in a computer ;-). </para>
        <!--FIXME - I need to rephrase the above -->

        <para> If you have comments regarding a certain translated string, please write that
(commented out with a <quote>#</quote>), so that we can go through it later. If you have more
than one equivalent string in your mind, write all of them, and comment all of them except the
one you think is the best. </para>

        <para> However, while commenting, remember that you <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> have
any comments between the <emphasis>msgid</emphasis> and <emphasis>msgstr</emphasis> lines.
        </para>

        <para> That means </para>

        <para> Also ...last but in no way the least, spellcheck, spellcheck, spellcheck. During
translation session - always sit with your dictionary, or even better, the <emphasis>Bangla
Baanaan Abhidhan</emphasis> from the Bangladesh Bangla Academy. The
<application>bspeller</application> from

      <sect3 id="testing">
        <title>Testing the translations</title>

        <para> One of the most tricky things for a translator is understanding the context. For
example, by simply looking at a pofile, a translator will have no clue whether
<emphasis>Open</emphasis> stands for <foreignphrase>Kholo</foreignphrase> or
<foreignphrase>Khola</foreignphrase>. To do context sensitive translation, a translator has
to check out his/her translations in action, that is, in the application interfaces. This
section describes a hack to see the translations without having to recompile the program.
        </para>

        <note>
          <para> This process works for most systems with GDM as the login manager. However, I
cannot guarantee that this will work on your system.  </para>
        </note>

        <para> To begin with, setup the <link linkend="locale">locale for Bangla</link> and
<link linkend="fonts">install some</link> Bangla fonts. </para>

        <para> Once that is done, get all the translated pofiles in a single folder in your
machine (to avoid mess), and one by one convert them into <acronym>MO</acronym> files with the
command: </para>

        <para>
          <prompt>bash$</prompt>
          <userinput>msgfmt -o file.mo file.version.gnomeversion_bn.po</userinput>
        </para>

        <caution>
          <para> While doing this, remember to strip all the version and language information
from the mo file's name, ie, <filename>gnome-games.gnome-2-4.bn.po</filename> should be
converted to <filename>gnome-games.mo</filename>. </para>

          <para> If you are unsure about a package, do a <command>rpm -ql packagename</command>, and you will get the naming
scheme for the package. For example, a part of the output of <command>rpm <option>-ql</option>
<parameter>gdm</parameter></command> reads
          </para>

          <programlisting>
          /usr/share/locale/ru/LC_MESSAGES/gdm-2.4.mo
          /usr/share/locale/sk/LC_MESSAGES/gdm-2.4.mo

          /usr/share/locale/ta/LC_MESSAGES/gdm-2.4.mo
          </programlisting>

          <para> From this, it becomes apparent that one has to issue the command
<command>msgfmt <option>-o</option> <parameter>gdm-2.4.mo gdm2.gnome-2-2.bn.po</parameter>
</command> for the <application>GDM</application> package. </para>
        </caution>

        <para> Once you are finished with that, copy the <acronym>MO</acronym> files to
<filename>/usr/share/locale/bn_IN.UTF-8</filename> or
<filename>/usr/share/locale/bn_BD.UTF-8</filename>, depending on how you set up your locale.
        </para>

        <para> Now, open up <filename>/etc/X11/gdm/locale.alias</filename> and add the following
lines to it. </para>

        <programlisting>
        Bengali                 bn_IN.UTF-8,bn_IN
        </programlisting>

        <para> After this, restart <application>X</application>, select Bengali in the Languages
menu and relogin into <application><acronym>GNOME</acronym></application>. You will be presented
with a Bangla system. </para>

        <note>
          <para> For testing a single application, you don't have to go through all this stuff.
Just setup the locale, install the font and put the <acronym>MO</acronym> file in the proper
place. Now, fire up <application>xterm</application>, and issue the command <command>export
LANG=bn_IN.UTF-8</command> or <command>export LANG=bn_BD.UTF-8</command>. After this, from xterm
itself, start the program you want to check, and it will start up with a Bangla interface.

      <title>Software which has Bangla rendering support</title>

      <para> Rendering of the Bangla script is a complex job, especially when one has to be
within the Unicode limits. Hence, the technology behind Bangla rendering is considered to be
quite <quote>bleeding edge</quote>, and only the latest software support it. For example, Bangla
text rendering support is there only in the latest <systemitem class="library">Qt</systemitem>
toolkit (Qt 3.2) which is used for <application><acronym>KDE</acronym></application> and
<ulink url="http://www.pango.org"><application>Pango</application></ulink>, which is the text
rendering/layout engine of <systemitem class="library">GTK 2</systemitem>. Pango 1.1.1 and above
has a seperate module for Bangla. In addition to that, in the Free Software world,
<ulink url="http://www.yudit.org"><application>Yudit</application></ulink> can render Bangla
text correctly. However, the situation is improving slowly, and in the near future, we will
probably see Bangla rendering in <application>Mozilla</application>,
<application>OpenOffice</application>, etc. In fact, the beta version of OpenOffice (at the time
of writing) has partial support for Bangla - however, it still has some serious problems with
the split vowel signs. Starting from version 3.2.0, KDE applications (will) officially support
Bangla rendering too. </para>
