<title>Purpose of the howto</title>

<para>
If you've got a Rockwell or Conexant chipset based modem and you can't seem to get the modem to work with Linux, then you've come to the right place. Chances are that you've got a Software modem (also known as a "winmodem") and you'll need a driver to get the modem working under Linux.
</para>

<para>
If you've got a Software modem whose chipset is not made by Conexant or Rockwell then you should see the <ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Linmodem-HOWTO.html"><citetitle>linmodem howto</citetitle></ulink>.

</para>

<para>
Note that this guide has no information about using Conexant/Rockwell modems for operating systems other then Linux except for the following: There are no known drivers for FreeBSD or BeOS, Windows drivers can be obtained from Conexant.

<sect2 id="about">
<title>About the howto</title>

<para>
This HOWTO originally started out as a website about installing Conexant HSF modems under linux, but after several months of being online the number of hits on the website was rapidly growing (100 hits/day at time of writing this HOWTO) and so were the number of requests for information about Rockwell/Conexant modems that were being posted to the linmodem mailing list, usenet and various web based forums. This lead me to decide that the information needed another distribution medium which would be more accessible to users. The result of this was this HOWTO which has expanded to include a far larger range of information then the original website had, in order to cover all the questions being asked on the internet.</para>
<para> At the same time as the increase in demand for information about Rockwell/Conexant modems under linux a number of non-english webpages appeared explaining how to setup the drivers in languages as diverse as Portuguese and Japanese, these webpages often lacked all the current information which was available making it harder for users to get their modems to work. I decided to release this HOWTO under the GNU Free Documentation License, so that native speakers of other language can translate this document into their own language and redistribute it freely, thus ensuring that all users get all the information regardless of what language they speak. If you're interested in making a translation of this HOWTO please contact me.</para>

<para>
The HOWTO assumes a basic knowledge of Linux, you should be familiar with the basics of how to use a console/terminal, how to use common commands like less and be familiar with a text editor.When the howto needs you to type something in at the console, the console prompt will look like this: '<prompt>&pt;</prompt>'
</para>

<para>
Some parts of the howto rely upon a greater knowledge of Linux, but those section will mainly apply if you have a non-standard Linux distribution.

<para> This section tries to get you up and running as soon as possible, if you can follow the steps given in this section and they work for you, you can ignore the rest of this howto. This section is updated more often then the rest of the HOWTO so will contain the most up to date information.</para>

<para>First you need to find out if your modem is an HSF or HCF modem. You can find out from your modem by looking at it's Windows drivers or looking at the label on it's chipset, or alternatively you can download the <ulink url="http://www.conexant.com/customer/md_driverassistance.html"><citetitle>ListModem</citetitle></ulink> utility and run it to get the information.

Drivers are available for both types, but the HSF driver is further into development then the HCF driver so is likely to be more advanced for now. Expect the HCF driver to come out of beta sometime mid-year(2002).

<title>Identifying your modem type</title>

<para>
The first task you will need to do is to identify whether your modem's chipset is HCF or HSF. Unfortunately the traditional way of doing this (by using /proc/pci, lspci or KDE's control center) won't work for us here due to errors in the pci.ids file which can cause a misidentification of the modem. There are three main ways which you can use to identify your modem's chipset:
</para>

<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<para>
If you've got your modem working under Windows then you can identify your chipset by downloading and running <ulink url="http://www.conexant.com/customer/md_driverassistance.html"><citetitle>Conexant's ListModem Application</citetitle></ulink>. When you run it, the program will give the information we want under "MODEM TYPE".
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
If you've opened your computer up chances are that the modem's chipset will have either the letters "HSF" or "HCF" printed on it.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
You can identify your type of modem from it's device ID and vendor ID, the easiest way get this information is from the command <command>lspci -n</command> (or <command>less /proc/pci</command> on older Linux distributions) this command tells you all of the Vendor IDs and Devices IDs for all of the PCI cards in your machine. You will be able to identify your modems' IDs as it will have a vendor ID of either 14F1 (Conexant) or 127A (Rockwell). Ignore any information that the lspci command tells you about your modem being a HSF or HCF as it could be wrong.
</para>
<para>The information is often presented in the form VVVV:DDDD where VVVV is the vendor ID and DDDD is the device ID, for instance if it listed 127a:2005 it would mean the that the Vendor ID is 127a and device ID is 2005.</para>

<para>
If your modem is a HCF modem it will have one of the following Device IDs:

<title>History</title>
<para>
A HSF driver first appeared out of the blue in mid-2000 when Olitec released unto the world a binary only driver for their Olitec PCI modem for 2.2.14 kernel, it wasn't long before someone realized that the Olitec modem was based on the Rockwell/Conexant HSF Chipset. Inquiries to Olitec revealed that the driver should work with any HSF chipset as there was nothing in the driver that was specific to the Olitec modems. Many people tried to get the driver to work with non-Olitec modem unfortunately without success, however a few months later and after many hours of work by many people trying a variety of tricks to get the driver to work, several people managed to stumble across the solution. It was a simple one line change to file which solved the problem and the world was left with a working HSF driver, at the time it only worked on 2.2.14 Kernels and Olitec had refused to release the source code to let others try to get it to work with other kernels.
</para>
<para>
A few months later Olitec released the driver for 2.2.16 and 2.2.17 kernels, this kept the HSF winmodem community satisfied until we came to the day when the 2.4 kernel was released. None of the previous drivers appeared to work with the 2.4 kernel and this caused problems for all those who wanted to upgrade and also for the large number of new users who were using 2.4.* kernel based distributions such as Mandrake 8 and RedHat 7.1. Not a word had been heard out of Olitec since the 2.4 kernel was released, but Conexant had announced that they intended to develop a Linux driver. After many months of waiting for a 2.4.* driver Marc Boucher decided to something about it and wrote a wrapper which allowed an old version of the driver to be used with 2.4.* kernels.
</para><para>
That's where we are now, Marc's wrapper is still in experimental development stage but it works and many people are using it to connect to the internet under Linux.
</para><para>
From the history you'll understand why the next section has to be split into two sections one for 2.2.14 - 2.2.18 kernels and one for 2.4.* kernels. If you don't know what kernel version you have you can find out by using the '<command>uname -r</command>' command at the console window before proceeding to the appropriate section of this HOWTO.

	Errors
	
	When running ./ins_all I get a kernel mismatch error ?

	This means that the driver thinks that you don't have a 2.2.14 kernel, if you have a variant of the 2.2.14 kernel (such as the one that comes with Mandrake 7) then you can still get the driver to work by loading up the file ins_all in a text editor and replacing all of the "insmod -m" commands with "insmod -f -m".

	When installing the driver when it tries to load myserial.o I get a segmentation fault ?

	This is caused by your computer trying to get Plug-and-Play to work with your modem. You can stop it doing this by going to your BIOS and setting an option which tells it not to do that. The settings name varies from BIOS to BIOS but is normally something like PnP OS.

	After installing the driver my Laptop's modem doesn't seem to work ?

	Sometime this is caused by a device conflict, you can correct it by editing the ins_all script by finding the line "mknod /dev/cnxt0 c 254 64" and replacing it with "mknod /dev/cnxt0 c 253 64"

<para>To get the modem working under a 2.4.* kernel you'll need to use the driver intended for 2.2.17 kernels alongside Marc Boucher's hsfcompat wrapper program which lets the driver work with 2.4.* kernels.

This error tends to be caused by the script being unable to find C Shell at the location <filename class="directory">/bin/csh</filename>. If you have C Shell installed in a different location then you should create a symbolic link which points to the correct location. If you don't have you'll need to install it.

This is often caused by the modem's device number clashing with that of PCMCIA, you can check if this is the case by entering the command,</para>
<para>&pt;<command>ls -l /dev/ | grep 254</command></para>
<para>You'll see the hsf0 device listed with the major number of 254, if any other device also has the major number of 254 it means there is a clash. You can fix this problem by loading up the ins_all file and change the line which reads "mknod /dev/cnxt c 254 64" to "mknod /dev/cnxt c 253 64".

      If you publish printed copies of the <link
      linkend="fdl-document">Document</link> numbering more than 100,
      and the Document's license notice requires <link
      linkend="fdl-cover-texts">Cover Texts</link>, you must enclose
      the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these
      Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
      Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also
      clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
      copies. The front cover must present the full title with all
      words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
      other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes
      limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
      <link linkend="fdl-document">Document</link> and satisfy these
      conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other

      you must either include a machine-readable <link

      each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
      publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a
      complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added
      material, which the general network-using public has access to
      download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network
      protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take
      reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
      copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
      remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
