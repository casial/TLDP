    <abstract>
      <para>The Pocket Linux Guide is for anyone interested in learning the
      techniques of building a GNU/Linux system from source code. The guide is
      structured as a project that builds a small diskette-based GNU/Linux
      system called Pocket Linux. Each chapter explores a small piece of the
      overall system explaining how it works, why it is needed and how to
      build it. After completing the Pocket Linux project, readers should
      possess an enhanced knowledge of what makes GNU/Linux systems work as
      well as the confidence to explore larger, more complex source-code-only
      projects.</para>
