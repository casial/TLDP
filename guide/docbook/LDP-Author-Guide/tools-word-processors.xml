<para>
	Even if you are not comfortable working DocBook's tagset
	in a text editor you can still produce valid DocBook
	documents using a word processor. Support at this point
	is very limited, but it does exist in the following
	programs. The up side, of course, is that things like
	spell check are built in to the program. In addition to
	this, support for DocBook (and XML) is constantly
	improving.

<para>
	As of OpenOffice.org (OOo) 1.1RC there has been support for
	exporting files to DocBook format.
</para>

<para>
	Although OOo uses the full DocBook document type declaration,
	it does not actually export the full list of DocBook elements. It
	uses a <quote>simplified</quote> DocBook tagset which is geared
	to on-the-fly rendering. (Although it is not the official
	Simplified DocBook which is described in <xref linkend="dtd" />.)
  The OpenOffice simplified (or <quote>special</quote> docbook) is available from
	<ulink url="http://xml.openoffice.org/xmerge/docbook/supported_tag_table.html" />.

	To be able to export to DocBook, you must have a Java runtime
  environment (JRE) installed and registered with OOo--a minimum of
  version 4.2.x is recommended. The configuration instructions will
  depend on how you installed your JRE.  Visit the OOo web site for
  help with your setup.

  Contrary to the OOo documentation, the Linux OOo did not come with
  a JRE. I got one from Sun.

<para>
	Conclusions: OOo 1.1RC is worth looking at if you want a word
	processor for preparing DocBook documents.
</para>

<para>
	However, I hope they cure the lack of documentation.  For one
	thing, it would be nice to know which native OOo styles map to
	which DocBook elements. It would also be nice to know how to
	map one's own OOo styles to DocBook elements.

<title>Open Office 1.1</title>
<para>
	<ulink url="http://www.merlinmonroe.com">Tabatha Marshall</ulink>
	offers the following additional information for OOo 1.1.
</para>

<blockquote>
	<para> The first problem was when I tried to do everything on version
	1.0.1.	That was
obviously a problem.  I have RH8, and it was installed via rpm packages,
so I ripped it out and did a full, new install of OpenOffice 1.1.
It took a while to find out 1.1 was a requirement for XML to work.
	</para>

	<para>
During the install process I believe I was offered the choice to install
the XML features.  I have a tendency to do full installs of my office
programs, so I selected everything.
	</para>

	<para>
I can't offer any advice to those trying to update their current
OO 1.1.  Their <quote>3 ways</quote> aren't documented very well at the site
(<ulink url="http://xml.openoffice.org">xml.openoffice.org</ulink>) and as of this writing, I can't even find THAT
on their site anymore.	I think more current documentation is needed
there to walk people through the process.  Most of this was unclear
and I had to pretty much experiment to get things working.
	</para>

	<para>
Well, after I installed everything I had some configuration to do.
I opened the application, and got started by opening a new file,
choosing templates, then selecting the DocBook template.  A nice menu
of <guisubmenu>Paragraph Styles</guisubmenu> popped up for me, which are the names for all those
tags, I noticed (you can see I don't use WYSIWYG often).
	</para>

	<para>
		With a blank doc before me (couldn't get to the <guisubmenu>XML Filter
		Settings</guisubmenu> menu unless some type of doc was opened), I went into
		<menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>XML
		Filter Settings</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, and edited the entry for DocBook file.
		I configured mine as follows:

	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
At first, if I opened an XML file that had even one parsing error, it
would just open the file anyway and display the markup in OO.  I have
many XML files that use &amp;copy; and other types of entities which show
up as parse errors (depending on the encoding) even though they can be
processed through.  But today I was unable to open any of those files.
I got input/output errors instead.  Still investigating that one.
	</para>

	<para>
However when you do successfully open a document (one parsing with no
errors), it puts it automatically into WYSIWYG based on the markup,
and you can then work from the paragraph styles menu like any other
such editor.
	</para>

	<para>
To validate the document, I used <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>XML
Filter Settings</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, then
clicked the <guibutton>Test XSLTs</guibutton> button.  On my screen, I set up the XSLT
for export to be <filename>ldp-html.xsl</filename>.	If you test and there are errors,
a new window pops up with error messages at the bottom, and the lines
that need to be changed up at the top.	You can change them there and
progress through the errors until they're all gone, and keep testing
until they're gone.
	</para>

	<para>
If you want to open a file to see the source instead of the processed
results, go to <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>XML Filter
Settings</guimenuitem><guisubmenu>Test XSLTs</guisubmenu></menuchoice>, and then
under the <menuchoice><guimenu>Import</guimenu></menuchoice> section, check the
<guilabel>Display Source</guilabel> box.  My import XSLT
is currently <filename>docbooktosoffheadings.xsl</filename> (the default) and the template
for import is <filename>DocBookTemplate.stw</filename> (also default).
	</para>

	<para>
I think this might work for some people, but unfortunately not for me.
I've never used WYSIWYG to edit markup.  <application>Emacs with
PSGML</application> can tell me
what my next tag is no matter where I am, validate by moving through
the trouble spots, and I can parse and process from command line.
	</para>

to find conversion tools.
