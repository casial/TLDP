  <title>Editing tools</title>
    <para>
	Editing tools have come a long way in their support for
	XML (and specifically DocBook). There are two types of
	editors outlined in this section: text editors (emacs,
	vim, etc); and word processors (OpenOffice, AbiWord,
	etc). New authors who are not comfortable working with
	markup languages should probably choose a word processor
	that can output DocBook files. For this reason the word
	processors are listed first.

    <para>
        Although many editors can also validate your DocBook
	files, this information has been separated into <xref
	linkend="tools-validate" />.
    </para>
