	<title>Why Validate Your Document</title>

	<para>
		The LDP uses a number of scripts to distribute your document.
		These scripts retrieve your document from the LDP's document
                version management system (currently git using GitHub), and
                then they transform your document to other formats that
		users then read. Your document will also be mirrored on a number
		of sites worldwide (yet another set of scripts).
	</para>
	
	<para>
		In order for these scripts to work correctly, your document must 
		be both <quote>well formed</quote> and use <quote>valid
		markup</quote>. 
		<emphasis>Well formed</emphasis> means your document follows the rules that XML
		is expecting: it complies with XML grammar rules. <emphasis>Valid
		markup</emphasis> means you only use elements or tags
		which are <quote>valid</quote> for your
		document: XML vocabulary rules are applied. 
	</para>

	<para>
		If your document is not well formed or uses invalid markup, the
		scripts will not be able to process it. As a result, your revised
		document will not be distributed.
