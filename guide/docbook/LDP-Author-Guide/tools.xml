    <title>System Setup: Editors, Validation and

    <para>In this section, we will cover some of the tools
	 that you may want to use to create your own LDP documentation.
    If you use some other tool to assist you in writing
	 documents for the LDP, please drop us a line and we'll add
	 a blurb for it here. <xref linkend="feedback" /> has contact
	 information.</para>

	 <section id="tools-distro"> <title>Tools for your operating
	 system</title>

	 <para>
		A few notes on setting up your system for DocBook
		publishing.  These tools focus more on the transformation
		of documents from DocBook to XHTML (for example).

		Tools for Docbook SGML and XML are included in the distrubution. So
		are <application>Emacs</application> and <application>PSGML
		mode</application>, although you will have to customize your

			So I just needed to get the TLDP XSL sheet and

<!--
	Tools to edit your document.  Pretty straight forward
	stuff. I'd like to update the screen shots so that they're a
	printer-friendly size. And add screen shots for VIM *hearts to
	vi* and Morphon and whoever else is missing pretty pictures.
--> 
&tools-edit;

<!--
	Tools to validate your XML/SGML There will be some duplication
	in here as editing and validation may or may not be considered
	the same thing. Mostly I'm keeping them separate because I use
	VIM and all the stuff on emacs is useless to me. ;)
--> 
&tools-validate;

<!--
	Tools to Transform DocBook to other formats Mostly this is
	a Jade/DSSSL section; but I'd like to add some XSLT stuff
	because...well...  I found it about 100 times easier to install.
