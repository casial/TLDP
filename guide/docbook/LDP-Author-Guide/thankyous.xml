				  <section id="ack1-3"> <title>Version 1 - Version 3</title> <para> Thanks
to everyone that gave comments as I was writing this. This includes David
Lawyer, Deb Richardson, Daniel Barlow, Greg Ferguson, Mark Craig and other
members of the <email>discuss@en.tldp.org</email> list. Some sections I
got from the <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/">HOWTO Index</ulink>
and the sgmltools documentation. The sections on network access to CVS was
partially written by Sergiusz Pawlowicz
(<email>ser@metalab.unc.edu</email>). Sections on DocBook were written by
Jorge Godoy (<email>godoy@conectiva.com</email>).  A great deal of thanks
to both of them for their help.  </para> </section>

finished the document. Thanks to my reviewers: Charles Curley, Martin
Brown and Tille; and to Saqib Ali for his on-line transformation and

LDP mailing lists. The original authors are credited within the document. 
Special personal thank yous are extended to Steve Champeon for getting me
interested in markup languages and for being a wonderful mentor; and to my
