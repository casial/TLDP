<chapter id="evmscreatesobj"><title>Creating Storage Objects</title>
<para>Storage objects are created from
	segments, regions, disks, or other storage
	objects. Storage objects are typically
	used when an EVMS specific feature is desired
	on a volume, such as Bad Block Relocation
	(BBR). </para>
<sect1 id="EVMSCRSO"><title>Using CLI</title>

	 <para>Storage objects are created using the
			<command>Create</command> command.  In this
			case, the arguments to the
			<command>Create</command> command are the
			keyword <command>Object</command> followed by the name of the EVMS feature to
			use along with its options, and the segments,
			disks, regions, and storage objects to use to
			create the new storage object.</para> 

			<note><title>Example</title>
			<para>Given the region <filename>lvm/Sample
			Container/Sample Region</filename>, create a
			storage object called BBR_Region using the
			EVMS Bad Block Relocation
			feature.</para></note> 

			<para>Because the BBR feature supports only
			one option, <option>name</option>, the command
			to complete this example is:</para> 

<programlisting>Create:Object,BBR={name=BBR_Region},"lvm/Sample Container/Sample Region"</programlisting> 

			<note><title>NOTE</title>
			<para>The EVMS CLI ignores spaces. Any name
			containing spaces must appear in quotation
			marks.</para></note>
