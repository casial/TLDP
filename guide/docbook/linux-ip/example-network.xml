    <title>Example Network Map and General Notes</title>
    <para>
      The below network map is a fictional network.  This network should
      provide examples of several of the common functions of a linux box in
      networking situations.  The hostnames used in the documentation are
      taken from this network map.  Where practical, I have tried to simulate
      real-world situations throughout the documentation, to ease the
      practical application of the concepts.

    <para>
      Because this guide focusses on linux networking, I have omitted discussion
      of the ISDN routers and unless relevant, the layer 2 devices (hubs and
      switches).  The remaining hosts on the example network can be
      broken into three main categories:  single-homed hosts (servers and
      workstations), masquerading (cf. NAT) routers, and public routers.
      For those viewing the above netmap from a security perspective,
      &wan-gw; and &masq-gw; would both run
      packet filters (at least), which turns the network into a traditional
      screened-subnet firewall.
    </para>
    <para>
      The LAN shown above is a common leaf-network scenario for business
      offices.  Frequently, there are one or two machines on a public network
      segment, a masquerading firewall, and one or more networks behind the
      masquerading firewall.  Please do not consider this example network the
      only way to interconnect devices.  The above is one method of designing
      a network--there are many practical issues to weigh in network design.
      I am deliberately skirting the issue of network design here and
      proposing an example network similar to or a superset of a commonly
      found network design.
    </para>
    <para>
      It is rare for a business which is not an ISP to own a class C sized
      network today, but I have nonetheless chosen a class C sized public
      network as our fictitious company's network.

        I have referred liberally to this example network throughout this
        documentation.  Any example commands in the documentation assume
        the network configuration as shown on this network map.

        Additionally, hosts which are not part of this (fictional) network but
        appear in the documentation will appear under the names &real-server;
        and &real-client;.  This convention exists simply to disambiguate
        real-world examples from the machines in the fictional network.
