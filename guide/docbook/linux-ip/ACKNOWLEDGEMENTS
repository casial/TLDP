  - Russ recommended adding a section covering bridging/gatewaying
    802.11 networks--added to the ROADMAP.  He suggested a section on
    tcpflow--section added to the skeleton in the tools / diagnostics
    section.  He suggested links for dsniff and libnet--added to the
    links page.

  - offered to translate into French

2002-09-26: Yann Hirou; Yann Hirou <hirou@linuxfr.org>

  - Yann observed that I was describing the difference between NAT
    and port address translation (port redirection) incorrectly.

2002-10-29: Julian Anastasov; Julian Anastasov <ja@ssi.bg>

  - Julian answered a question which had me stonewalled about the
    way the kernel selects routes.

2002-11-14: Bert Hubert; bert hubert <ahu@ds9a.nl>

  - Bert helped me conquer the random HTML filename problem
    the solution is to define a particular variable for the openjade
    processor:  "-V %use-id-as-filename%" on the command line, does it

2002-11-30: Tony Kapela; Xam R. Time <xam@chalupa.wi2600.org>

  - Tony described some tools he uses to diagnose characteristics of
    network links.  These worked their way into my toolbox, and were
    included in the "Links to Software" portion of the appendix.

2003-01-11: George Georgalis; George Georgalis <george@galis.org>

  - George pointed out a few stupidly phrased paragraphs and
    sentences.  He made a few recommendations for better titles and
    a re-ordering of the NAT, SNAT/Masquerading and PAT chapters.

2003-01-30: giovanni; gq <giovanni@perlportalNOSPAM.com>

  - Giovanni suggested entering an item for the slackware configuration
    files--/etc/rc.d/rc.inet{1,2} and a correction to an obvious error
    in Example 2.3.

2003-02-02: Alex Russell; Alex Russell <alex@netWindows.org>

  - Alex has assisted tremendously in some DocBook nits and moral
    support.  In particular, he has been helping in the background
    for quite some time on matters of XSLT stylesheets.

2003-02-06: Giovanni Quadriglio; gq <giovanni@perlportalNOSPAM.com>

  - Giovanni suggests two corrections to examples in the basic
    section.  These were examples with the wrong flags in the route
    output.

2003-02-08: Giovanni Quadriglio; gq <giovanni@perlportalNOSPAM.com>

  - Giovanni provided a PMTU example, which is available in the
    document source of the routing chapter.  I'll incorporate it when
    I'm working on that content.

2003-02-28: Gilles Douillet "Gilles, Douillet" <gilles@uniskill.com>

  - Gilles noted a typographical error in a NAT example, and has
    offered to contribute to the project with some examples of SNAT
    and pools of addresses.

2003-05-12: Giovanni Quadriglio; gq <giovanni@perlportalNOSPAM.com>

  - Giovanni corrected the scripts/proxy-arp.conf configuration
    file which included some (sadly) very obvious errors.

2003-05-19: Carol Anne Ogdin; Carol Anne Ogdin <caogdin@deepwoods.com>

  - Carol Anne pointed out that the term network address has to be
    understood by context, and that there were really two meanings to
    this term.
