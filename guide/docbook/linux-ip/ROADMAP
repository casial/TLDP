Minor items and required experiments:

 - complete the cookbook chapters on advanced routing
 - binding to non-local IPs
   - pass traffic on a router while bound to a non-local; should
     get caught--other traffic should pass through
   - pass traffic on a bridge while bound to a non-local; should
     get caught--other traffic should pass through
 - ARP tests
   - use kernel proxy_arp with medium_id (sysctl)
 - learn how to read ip -s route show cache; what is cwnd, rtt, rttvar
   and advmss, and how to use the info
 - use ip route add default nexthop
 - test NAT from a host in one IP address range to a host in another
   address range which happens to share the same media segment
   - suppress redirects?
 - test single and multiple dummy interfaces
 - link layer broadcast; use ip link set broadcast to change the ethernet
   broadcast address on several hosts and see what happens
 - add references to MPLS; diffserv?  Traffic Control?
 - add section on VRRP
 - add sysctl brief HOWTO and point to ipsysctl-tutorial
 - add TCP/IP <--> OSI networking model pointers (layer 2, layer 3, etc.)
 - add mailing list references
 - add ethtool and mii-diag to mii-tool subsection

Major work:

 - revamp the entire "cookbook" sections -- pitch? rewrite?
 - add glossary
 - add command synopses for all commands
 - edit the tools appendices for accuracy, grammar, spelling
 - add bridging 802.11; gatewaying 802.11
 - consider chapter introducing traffic control with pointer to LARTC
