  <title>Troubleshooting</title>
  <para>
    Invariably, troubles and misconfigurations creep into networks.  New
    devices get connected and added to a network.  Old devices are removed,
    and something seemingly unrelated breaks.  Troubleshooting is really a
    test in discerning patterns.

    My favored method for solving problems is to start with the simplest
    elements, verifying correct operation and proceeding to the next layer or
    element until I have isolated the problem element.  If you are lucky,
    you'll know from a symptom where the problem is likely to be, but more
    often, you'll have to start at the bottom of the networking hierarchy, and
    verify each other layer.

      The first thing to consider whenever somebody reports a strange
      networking problem is any recent change.  What has changed recently in
      the network?  Have any new machines been added?  Is the user using a
      service which was recently decommissioned?  Did a machine (firewall,
      mail server, DNS resolver) recently reboot?  Did all of the services
      restart?
