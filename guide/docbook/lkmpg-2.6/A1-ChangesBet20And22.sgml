			<para>I don't know the entire kernel well enough to document all of the changes.
			Some hints for porting can be found by comparing this version of the LKMPG with it's counterpart for
			kernel 2.4. Apart from that, anybody who needs to port drivers from 2.4 to 2.6 kernels might want to visit
			<ulink url="http://lwn.net/Articles/driver-porting/"> http://lwn.net/Articles/driver-porting/ </ulink>.
			If you still can't find an example that exactly meets your needs there, find a driver that's similar to your driver
			and present in both kernel versions. File comparison tools like <command> xxdiff </command> or 
			<command> meld </command> can be a great help then. Also check if your driver is covered by docs in
			<filename> linux/Documentation/ </filename>. Before starting with porting and in case you're stuck it's 
			a good idea to find an appropiate mailinglist and ask people there for pointers.
