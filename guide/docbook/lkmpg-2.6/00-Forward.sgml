<sect1><title>Authorship</title>

	<para>The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide was originally written for the 2.2 kernels by Ori Pomerantz.  Eventually, Ori
	no longer had time to maintain the document.  After all, the Linux kernel is a fast moving target.  Peter Jay Salzman took
	over maintenance and updated it for the 2.4 kernels.  Eventually, Peter no longer had time to follow developments with the 2.6
	kernel, so Michael Burian became a co-maintainer to update the document for the 2.6 kernels.</para>

<sect1><title>Versioning and Notes</title>

	<para>The Linux kernel is a moving target.  There has always been a question whether the LKMPG should remove deprecated
	information or keep it around for historical sake.  Michael Burian and I decided to create a new branch of the LKMPG for each
	new stable kernel version.  So version LKMPG 2.4.x will address Linux kernel 2.4 and LKMPG 2.6.x will address Linux kernel
	2.6.  No attempt will be made to archive historical information; a person wishing this information should read the
	appropriately versioned LKMPG.</para>

	<para>The source code and discussions should apply to most architectures, but I can't promise anything.  One exception is
	<xref linkend="interrupthandlers">, Interrupt Handlers, which should not work on any architecture except for x86.</para>
