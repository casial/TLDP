<sect1><title>TODO: Write a chapter about sysfs</title>

<para> This is just a placeholder for now. Finally I'd like to see a 
(yet to be written) chapter about sysfs instead here. If you are familiar
with sysfs and would like to take part in writing this chapter, feel free to
contact us (the LKMPG maintainers) for further details.
