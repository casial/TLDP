Computer Algebra System Yet Another Computer Algebra System is a small and highly flexible computer algebra language. The syntax is very close to Mathematica.

WAD file editor for doom-style WADs Yadex is a Doom level (wad) editor for Unix systems running X, including Linux. It supports Doom alpha, Doom beta, Doom, Ultimate Doom, Final Doom, Doom II, Heretic and also, in a more or less limited way, Hexen and Strife. It is available under the terms of the GPL. Yadex is descended from DEU 5.21. Therefore, as you might expect, it&apos;s a rather low-level editor that requires you to take care of a lot of detail but on the flip side allows you to control very precisely what you are doing. In addition, it has many advanced functions that DEU didn&apos;t have, to make certain tedious tasks easy. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Perl scripts to build rescue disk(s) to revive a system Yard is a suite of Perl scripts for creating custom boot/rescue disks.  Using a compressed filesystem, it can put a standard kernel image plus about 2.4 meg of utilities on a single floppy.  Yard is also useful for creating self-contained Linux-on-a-floppy systems. You specify a basic set of files and utilities for inclusion and Yard handles many of the details.  Features:  - File specs allow absolute and relative filenames, symbolic links,    file replacements and full shell-style globbing.  - Automatically determines necessary libraries and loaders.  - Allows stripping of binaries and libraries during copying.  - Automatically regenerates ld.so.cache  - Checks for broken symlinks  - Checks /etc/{fstab,inittab,termcap,pam.conf} for common errors and    inconsistencies.  - Checks user directories and files mentioned in /etc/passwd  - Checks command files (eg, rc.local and .login) and scripts for    missing binaries and command interpreters.  - Automatically performs filesystem compression and copying.  - Can be used with or without LILO.  - Can make single or double disk sets.  - Extensive checking of user choices and execution errors.

A small freeware Forth environment in ANSI C. yForth? is an interestingly small implementation of Forth for Linux.  It suffers several deficiencies.  For general Forth programming or learning under Linux, yForth? is not the best choice. From the author&apos;s README: yForth? is a Forth environment written entirely in ANSI C, making it extremely portable. The first thing I want to tell you about yForth? is that it seems a joke compared to other systems such as gForth or PFE. Nevertheless, you could find yForth? nice, in which case you&apos;re invited to explore yForth? It&apos;s yours, you can make anything you want with it. If you want an explanation of the words provided by yForth? please refer to the draft of ANS Forth or something equivalent.  The Net will help you. Do not expect the prompt &quot;ok&quot; to come up when you run yForth?, the standard says that &quot;ok&quot; shall be printed AFTER every successful command execution... From Debian 3.0r0 APT

interpreted language and scientific graphics Yorick is an interpreted programming language for:  * scientific simulations or calculations  * postprocessing or steering large simulation codes  * interactive scientific graphics  * reading, writing, and translating large files of numbers The language features a compact syntax for many common array operations, so it processes large arrays of numbers very quickly and efficiently.  Superficially, yorick code resembles C code, but yorick variables are never explicitly declared and have a dynamic scoping similar to many Lisp dialects.  The yorick language is designed to be typed interactively at a keyboard, as well as stored in files for later use. This package includes an emacs-based development environment, which you can launch by typing M-x yorick in emacs. ftp://ftp-icf.llnl.gov/pub/Yorick/doc/index.html From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Combining with POP, youbin eliminate a lot of NFS mount of mail spool for mail arrival checking.

The Network Information Service (NIS) is a system that provides network information (login names, passwords, home directories, group information) to all of the machines on a network. NIS can allow users to log in on any machine on the network, as long as the machine has the NIS client programs running and the user&apos;s password is recorded in the NIS passwd database. NIS was formerly known as Sun Yellow Pages(YP). This NIS implementation is based on FreeBSD&apos;s YP and is a special port for glibc 2.x and libc versions 5.4.21 and later. This package only provides the NIS client programs. In order to use the clients, you need to have an NIS server running on your network. An NIS server is provided in the ypserv package. Install the yp-tools package if you need NIS client programs for machines on your network. You will also need to install the ypbind package on every machine running NIS client programs. If you need an NIS server, you need to install the ypserv package on one machine on the network. From Redhat 8.0 RPM
