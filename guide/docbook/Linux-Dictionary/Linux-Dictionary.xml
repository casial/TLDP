<abstract>
<para>
This document is designed to be a resource for those Linux users wishing
to seek clarification on Linux/UNIX/POSIX related terms and jargon. At
approximately 24000 definitions and two thousand pages it is one of the largest
Linux related dictionaries currently available. Due to the rapid rate at which 
new terms are being created it has been decided that this will be an active 
project. We welcome input into the content of this document. At this moment
in time half yearly updates are being envisaged.

<para>Geona, operated by Gold Vision Communications, is a new 
powerful search engine and internet directory, delivering quick
and relevant results on almost any topic or subject you can imagine.
The term "Geona" is an Italian and Hebrew name, meaning wisdom,
exaltation, pride or majesty. We use our own database of spidered 
web sites and the Open Directory database, the same database which
powers the core directory services for the Web's largest and most
popular search engines and portals. Geona is spidering all domains
listed in the non-adult part of the Open Directory and millions of
additional sites of general interest to maintain a fulltext index
of highly relevant web sites.</para>

<para>LINUXDIG.COM, "Yours News and Resource Site",
LinuxDig.com was started in May 2001 as a hobby site with the
original intention of getting the RFC's online and becoming an
Open Source software link/download site. But since that time the site
has evolved to become a RFC distribution site, linux news site 
and a locally written technology news site (with bad grammer :))
with focus on Linux while also containing articles about anything 
and everything we find interesting in the computer world. LinuxDig.Com 
contains about 20,000 documents and this number is growing everyday!

at a fraction of the cost of traditional publishing.
We also offer corporate publishing solutions that enable businesses to
produce and deliver manuals and documentation more efficiently and
economically. Our use of electronic delivery and print-on-demand technologies
reduces printed inventory and saves time.</para>
