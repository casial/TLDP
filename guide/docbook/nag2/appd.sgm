If you are not getting everything you need from posting to
<systemitem role="newsgroup">comp.os.linux.*</systemitem> groups and reading documentation, maybe it's time to
consider joining SAGE, the System Administrators Guild, sponsored by
USENIX.  The main goal of SAGE is to advance system administration as
a profession.  SAGE brings together system and network administrators
to foster professional and technical development, share problems and
solutions, and communicate with users, management, and vendors on
system administration topics.
