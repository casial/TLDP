      This work covers tuning Linux and the hardware it runs on
      for the best efficiency.  This can make existing hardware
      run faster, or give network architechts information to make
      informed decisions about servers and their requirements.

   <para>
     The idea of a book on tuning Linux for performance is pretty much
     a moving target.  Linux makes advances at a rapid pace, and things
     change often.  Since its introduction in 1991, Linux has gone
     from a state where it could not compile itself (and barely boot)
     into a system that can take up to three full CD-ROMs to install
     much of the software.  It rivals operating systems twice its
     age in terms of performance and stability.  Its complete
     heritage may never be known because of the thousands of people
     around the world who have contributed patches, drivers, and
     enhancements to make Linux better.
   </para>
   <para>
     This advancement means that some portions of Linux
     can literally turn on a dime.  The Linux 2.0 kernel used
     a program called ipfwadm to administer its firewall settings.
     When 2.2 came out, the program was ipchains, and used completely
     different concepts than ipfwadm.  The 2.4 kernel uses iptables,
     which itself is different from its predecessors.  This means
     that Linux has little baggage holding it back when it comes
     to backwards compatability.  Some open source applications
     need no changes, most may need to be recompiled, and some
     require programming changes that can be done by any
     programmer.  The idea of backwards compatability in Linux
     is a foreign concept.
   </para>
   <para>
     But tuning Linux is more than just tuning what you have.  It
     is looking at your requirements, evaluating the technology that
     can solve that requirement, and going with the balance between
     cost and performance.  Not everyone can afford the best cards, but
     the difference between good and poor performance can be a very small
     cost as compared to the overall system cost.

    the kind of tuning you want to do.

        <para>
	  What is the nature of performance tuning?  How should you go about
	  looking at an entire system in terms of improving the services it
	  provides to others?  What common strategies are available?  We will go
	  through the basics of performance tuning in detail for this chapter.

        <para>
	  This chapter will deal with measuring performance from a system on
	  various levels, outling common tools bundled with your Linux system or
	  available on the Internet.  Once you know how fast your system is in
	  its current state, you have a baseline to measure against.
