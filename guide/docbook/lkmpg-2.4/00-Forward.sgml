<sect1><title>Acknowledgements</title>

	<para>Ori Pomerantz would like to thank Yoav Weiss for many helpful ideas and discussions, as well as finding mistakes within
	this document before its publication.  Ori would also like to thank Frodo Looijaard from the Netherlands, Stephen Judd from
	New Zealand, Magnus Ahltorp from Sweeden and Emmanuel Papirakis from Quebec, Canada.</para>

	<para>I'd like to thank Ori Pomerantz for authoring this guide in the first place and then letting me maintain it.  It was a
	tremendous effort on his part.  I hope he likes what I've done with this document.</para>

	<para> I would also like to thank Jeff Newmiller and Rhonda Bailey for teaching me.  They've been patient with me and lent me
	their experience, regardless of how busy they were.  David Porter had the unenviable job of helping convert the original LaTeX
	source into docbook.  It was a long, boring and dirty job.  But someone had to do it.  Thanks, David.</para>

	<para> Thanks also goes to the fine people at <ulink url="www.kernelnewbies.org">www.kernelnewbies.org</ulink>.  In
	particular, Mark McLoughlin and John Levon who I'm sure have much better things to do than to hang out on kernelnewbies.org
	and teach the newbies.  If this guide teaches you anything, they are partially to blame.</para>

	<para>Both Ori and I would like to thank Richard M. Stallman and Linus Torvalds for giving us the opportunity to not only run
	a high-quality operating system, but to take a close peek at how it works.  I've never met Linus, and probably never will, but
	he has made a profound difference in my life.</para>

	<para>The following people have written to me with corrections or good suggestions: Ignacio Martin, David Porter, and Dimo Velev</para>

<sect1><title>Authorship And Copyright</title>

	<para>The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide (lkmpg) was originally written by Ori Pomerantz.  It became very popular as
	being the best free way to learn how to program Linux kernel modules.  Life got busy, and Ori no longer had time or
	inclination to maintain the document.  After all, the Linux kernel is a fast moving target.  Peter Jay Salzman (that's me)
	offered to take over maintainership so at least bug fixes and occaisional updating would happen.  If you would like to </para>

<sect1><title>Nota Bene</title>

	<para>Ori's original document was good about supporting earlier versions of Linux, going all the way back to the 2.0 days.
	I had originally intended to keep with the program, but after thinking about it, opted out.  My main reason to keep with the
	compatibility was for GNU/Linux distributions like LEAF, which tended to use older kernels.  However, even LEAF uses 2.2 and
	2.4 kernels these days.</para>

	<para>Both Ori and I use the x86 platform.  For the most part, the source code and discussions should apply to other
	architectures, but I can't promise anything.  One exception is <xref linkend="interrupthandlers">, Interrupt
	Handlers, which should not work on any architecture except for x86.</para>
