<abstract>

<para>
   Mobile computer devices (laptops, notebooks, PDAs, mobile cell phones,
   portable audio and video players, digital cameras,
   calculators, wearables, ...) are different from desktop/tower computers.
   They use certain hardware such as PCMCIA cards,
   infrared and BlueTooth ports, wireless LAN,  LCD displays, batteries,
   docking stations. Hardware parts cannot be changed as easily as in a
   desktops, e.g. the graphics card. Often their hardware is more limited
   (e.g. disk space, CPU speed). Though the performance gap to
   desktops is becoming smaller, e.g. in many instances, laptops or
   notebooks can become a desktop replacement.
</para>

<para>
   Hardware support for Linux (and other operating systems) and mobile
   computer devices is sometimes more limited (e.g. graphics chips, internal modems).
   They often use specialized hardware, hence finding a driver can be more
   difficult. Many times they are used in changing environments, so there
   is a need for multiple configurations and additional security
   strategies.
</para>

<para>
   Though there are laptop, notebook, PDA and mobile phone 
   related HOWTOs available already, this guide contains 
   a concise survey of documents related to mobile computer
   devices. Also Linux features, such as installation methods 
   for laptops, notebooks and PDAs as well as configurations for
   different (network) environments are described.
</para>

<para>
   Although there are some caveats, Linux is a better choice for mobile
   computer devices than most other operating systems, because it supports
   numerous installation methods, works in many heterogeneous environments
   and needs smaller resources.

<para>
   People like either laptops or desktops. I like to work with laptops
   rather than with desktops. I like Linux too. My first HOWTO was the

<title>Disclaimer and Trademarks</title>

<para>
   This is free documentation. It is distributed in the hope that it will
   be useful, but without any warranty. The information in this document is
   correct to the best of my knowledge, but there's a always a chance I've
   made some mistakes, so don't follow everything too blindly, especially
   if it seems wrong. Nothing here should have a detrimental effect on your
   computer, but just in case,  I take no responsibility for any damages
   incurred from the use of the information contained herein.
</para>

<para>
   Some laptop manufacturers don't like to see a broken laptop with an
   operating system other than the one shipped with it, and may reload
   MS-Windows if you complain of a hardware problem. They may even declare
   the warranty void. Though in my humble opinion this isn't legal or at
   least not fair. Always have a backup of both the original configuration
   and your Linux installation if you have to get your laptop repaired.
</para>

<para>
   Though I hope trademarks will be superfluous sometimes (you may see what I mean at 
   <ulink url="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">Open Source Definition</ulink>
   ), I declare: If certain words are trademarks, the context should make it
   clear to whom they belong. For example "MS Windows NT" implies that
   "Windows NT" belongs to Microsoft (MS). "Mac" is a trademark by Apple
   Computer. Many of the designations used by manufacturers and sellers to
   distinguish their products are claimed as trademarks. Where those
   designations appear in this book, and I was aware of a trademark claim,
   the designations have been printed in caps or initial caps. All
   trademarks belong to their respective owners.

   Portable computers may be divided into different categories. This is a
   subjective decision, but I try to do so. My groupings roughly follow the
   generally accepted marketing categories. The criteria could be:
</para>

<para>

<orderedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
   <indexterm><primary>weight</primary></indexterm>
   Weight: Often expressed in terms like Portables, Laptops/Notebooks,
   Sub/Mini-Notebooks, Palmtops/PDAs. There is no standard method to define
   the weight of a laptop, therefore the data provided by the manufacturers
   (and which are given below) have to be considered as approximations. The
   question is how the power supply (whether external or internal) or
   swappable parts like CD and floppy drive, are included in the weight.

<!--

   notebook/laptop
   - laptop was the original name, back to the times when 
     portable PCs where derived more or less from 
     ordinary desktop PCs and very heavy, app. 7kg
   - notebooks were the next generation app. less than 3kg and A4 size
   - times are changing again, since notebooks become desktop replacements

-->

</para>

<para>
   Most peripheral <indexterm><primary>cables</primary></indexterm> cables
   are appallingly heavy. If you get a subnotebook and carry it around with
   a bunch of external drives, cables, and <emphasis>port

   heavier bag than if it were all in one box. Subnotebooks are useful

<para>
   Due to a lack of support by some manufacturers, not every feature of a

   may cause trouble are: graphics chip, <trademark
   class="registered">IrDA</trademark> port, sound card,
   <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> controller , PnP devices and internal modem.
   Please try to get as much information about these topics before buying a
   laptop. But often it isn't quite easy to get the necessary information.
   Sometimes even the specifications or the hotline of the manufacturer
   aren't able to provide the information. Therefore I have included a
   Linux Compatibility Check chapter in every section of

<para>
   Depending on your needs, you might investigate one of the vendors that

   Recent laptops come with 
   <emphasis>active</emphasis> matrix (TFT) displays. 
   Laptops with <emphasis>passive</emphasis> matrix (DSTN) are no longer manufactured.
   Active matrix
   displays have better color and contrast, but usually cost
   more and use more power. Also consider the screen size.
   Laptops may be purchased with screens up to 17". A bigger
   screen weighs more, costs more, and is harder to carry,
   but is good for a portable desktop replacement.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Batteries</title>

<para>
   The available battery types are <emphasis>Lithium Ion
   (LiIon)</emphasis>, <emphasis>Nickel Metal Hydride (
   NiMH)</emphasis> and <emphasis>Nickel Cadmium
   (NiCd)</emphasis>. Though almost all current laptops come
   with LiIon batteries.
</para>

<para>
   LiIon batteries are the most expensive ones but a lot lighter
   than NiCd for the same energy content, and have minimal - but
   present - memory effects. NiMH is better than NiCd, but still
   rather heavy and does suffer some (although less than NiCd)
   memory effects.
</para>

<para>
   Unfortunately most laptops come with a proprietary battery
   size. So they are not interchangeable between different
   models.

   "Much like laptops of the Intel/Linux world, Mac laptops have generally
   different setups that can be very hard to figure out.  Also, because of
   a general lack of machines to test, we are only aware of boots on the
   Powerbook 145, Powerbook 150, Powerbook 170, Powerbook 180, and
   Powerbook 190. Even if it boots, we currently have no support for
   Powerbook-style ADB, the <acronym>APM</acronym> support, or just about
   anything else on them. This means the only way to log in is with a
   terminal hooked up to the serial interface, this has been tested on the

   processor without FPU, and many of these processors are broken with
   respect to the FPU trap mechanism so they can't run regular Linux
   binaries even with FPU emulation. Current status on Powerbooks 140, 160,

<title>Miscellaneous</title>

<para>
   At higher speed, a CPU consumes more power and generates more heat.
   Therefore, in many laptops a special low-power CPU is used.
   Usually, this special CPU doesn't use as much power as a similar
   processor used in a desktop. These special CPUs are also more expensive.
   As a side effect you may find that laptops with a desktop CPU often have
   a quite noisy fan.

<title>Cooling</title>

<para>
   An enormously important issue.  Anything based on PPC or Pentium will
   generate enormous amounts of heat which must be dissipated. Generally,
   this means either a fan, or a heat sink the size of the case. If it's a
   fan, the air path shouldn't get blocked, or it will overheat
   and burn out. This means machines with a fan mounted in the bottom are a
   big, big mistake: you can't use them on a soft surface.

<title>Keyboard Quality</title>

<para>
   Though you might use your desktop computer to do longer writings, a good
   keyboard can save you some head- and fingeraches. Look especially
   for the location of special keys like: <command>&lt;ESC&gt;</command>,
   <command>&lt;TAB&gt;</command>, <command>&lt;Pos1&gt;</command>,
   <command>&lt;End&gt;</command>, <command>&lt;PageDown&gt;</command>,

<title>Price</title>

<para>
   Laptops are quite expensive if you compare them with desktops (though
   maybe not if compared with <acronym>LCD</acronym>, 
   <trademark class="registered">IrDA</trademark>, <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym>
   capabilities). So you may decide between a brand or no-name product.
   Though I would like to encourage you to take a
   <emphasis>no-name</emphasis> product, there are some caveats. I have
   experienced that laptops break often, so you are better off, when you
   have an after-sales warranty, which is usually only offered with brand
   products. Or you may decide to take a <emphasis>second hand</emphasis>
   machine. When I tried this, I discovered that the laptop market is
   changing quite often.  A new generation is released approximately every
   three months (compared by CPU speed, harddisk capacity, screen size
   etc.). So laptops become old very quick. But this scheme often isn't
   followed by the prices for second hand laptops. They seem too expensive
   to me. Anyway if you plan on purchasing a second hand machine, review my
   recommendations on checking the machine.

<title>Power Supply</title>

<para>
   If you travel abroad pay attention to the voltage levels which are

   is different from country to country.

   If you happen to be a Linux distributor, thank you for reading all this.
   Laptops are becoming more and more popular, but still most Linux

   The installation routine should include a configuration, optimized for
   laptops. The <emphasis>minimal install</emphasis> is often not lean
   enough. There are a lot of things that a laptop user does not need on

   versions of <command>vi</command>. Some portable systems do not
   need printing support.

<para>
   Don't forget to describe <emphasis>laptop-specific installation
   problems</emphasis>, e. g. how to install your distribution without a
   CD/DVD-ROM drive.
</para>

<para>
   Add better <emphasis>power management</emphasis> and seamless
   <emphasis><acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> support</emphasis> to your
   distribution. Add a recompiled kernel and an alternative set of
   <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> drivers with <emphasis>apm support</emphasis>
   that the user can install on demand. Include a precompiled
   <emphasis>apmd package</emphasis> with your distribution. Also include
   <trademark class="registered">IrDA</trademark> infrared support and
   <acronym>USB</acronym> support.
</para>

<para>
   Add support for dynamically <emphasis>switching network
   configurations</emphasis>. Most Linux laptops travel between locations

<para>
   The 
   <ulink url="http://www.debian.org">Debian/GNU Linux</ulink>
   has most of the desired features for a laptop installation. The
   distribution has a quite flexible installation tool. The installation
   process is well documented, especially concerning the methods which
   are useful for laptops. All the binaries are tiny, because they are
   stripped. A mailing list <emphasis>debian-laptop</emphasis> including
   a searchable archive is provided. And Debian/GNU Linux is free.
</para>

<para>
   At the end of August 1999 the 
   <ulink url="http://tuxmobil.org/debian_linux.html">Debian Laptop Distribution - Proposal</ulink>
   was issued. And some more laptop related packages and a Debian 
   <emphasis>meta-package</emphasis> dedicated to laptops are on the way.

   Note: I know other Linux distributions work well with laptops, too. I
   even tried some of them, see my pages about certain laptops mentioned

<title>Caveats</title>

<para>
   Before repartitioning your hard disk take care about the disk layout.
   Especially look for hidden disk space or certain partitions used for
   <emphasis>suspend to disk</emphasis> or <emphasis>hibernation</emphasis>
   mode. Some laptops come with a partition which contains some
   <acronym>BIOS</acronym> programs (e.g. COMPAQ Armada 1592DT). Search the
   manual carefully for tools like <command>PHDISK.EXE</command>, Suspend
   to Disk, Diagnostic TOOLS.
</para>

<para>
   <ulink url="http://www.procyon.com/~pda/lphdisk/">Patrick D. Ashmore</ulink>
   has recently released a Linux utility to prepare hibernation
   partitions for use with laptops and notebooks using Phoenix
   NoteBIOS. "This utility isn't needed to utilize the
   <acronym>APM</acronym> "Suspend-To-Disk" feature ... if you
   already have a valid hibernation partition, you should be able to
   use it from any operating system that can handle
   <acronym>APM</acronym> suspends.
</para>

<para>
   However, if one ever upgrades hard drive, memory, or repartitions their
   hard drive, they discover that they either have to do without the
   suspend-to-disk feature or boot to DOS and use the
   <command>PHDISK.EXE</command> program provided with their laptop or
   directly from Phoenix Technologies.
</para>

<para>
   Now, Linux users are free from this restriction.
   <command>lphdisk</command> is a Linux utility that properly prepares
   these partitions for use. Not only does this eliminate having to boot to
   DOS, but my utility does not exhibit some of the nastier bugs that its
   DOS counterpart has."

<title>From a Boot Floppy plus CD/DVD-ROM - The Traditional Way</title>

<para>
   With modern laptops, the traditional Linux installation 
   method (from one boot floppy, one support
   floppy and a package of CD-ROMs or one DVD) should be no problem, if there
   is a floppy drive and a CD-ROM drive available. Though with certain laptops
   you might get trouble, if you can not use
   <emphasis>the floppy drive and the CD/DVD-ROM drive </emphasis> simultaneously,
   or if the floppy drive is <emphasis>only available as a <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym>
   device</emphasis>, as with the Toshiba Libretto 100. Some laptops
   support also booting and therefore installation completely from a CD
   drive, as reported for the SONY VAIO in the 
   <ulink url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/VAIO+Linux.html">VAIO+Linux-HOWTO</ulink>
   . Note: Check the
   <acronym>BIOS</acronym> for the CD boot option and make sure your Linux
   distribution comes on a bootable CD.
</para>

<para>
   Certain laptops will only boot <emphasis>zImage</emphasis> kernels.
   <emphasis>bzImage</emphasis> kernels won't work. This is a known problem
   with the <trademark>IBM</trademark> Thinkpad 600 and Toshiba Tecra
   series, for instance. Some distributions provide certain boot floppies

<title>From a Second Machine With a Micro Linux On a Floppy</title>

<sect3>
<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
   Because of their small or nonexistent footprint, micro-Linuxes are
   especially suited to run on laptops, particularly if you use a
   company-provided laptop running Windows9x/NT. Or for installation
   purposes using another non Linux machine. There are several
   <emphasis>micro</emphasis> Linux distributions out there that boot from
   one or two floppies and run off a ramdisk. See 
   <xref linkend="mobile-guide-a1-other-operating-systems"/> Appendix A
   for a listing of distributions.
</para>

<para>
   I tried the following with <command>muLinux</command> ( available at 
   <ulink url="http://sunsite.auc.dk/mulinux">muLinux</ulink>
   ) to clone my HP OmniBook 800 to a COMPAQ Armada 1592DT. 
   Thanks to Michele Andreoli, maintainer of muLinux for his support. 
   Since <command>muLinux</command> doesn't support 
   <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> yet, you may use <command>TomsRtBt</command> 
   instead. In turn <command>TomsRtBt</command> doesn't support 
   <command>PPP</command> but provides <command>slip</command>. 
   Note: Since version 7.0 <command>muLinux</command> 
   provides an Add-On with <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> support.
</para>

<para>
   I have described how to copy an already existing partition, but it might
   also be possible to achieve a customized installation. Note: Usually you
   would try to achieve an installation via NFS, which is supported by many
   distributions. Or if your sources are not at a Linux machine you might
   try the SMB protocol with SAMBA, which is also supported by
   <command>muLinux</command> .
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Prerequisites</title>

<para>
   You need two machines equipped with Linux. With the laptop
   (client/destination) on which you want to install Linux use the muLinux
   floppy. The other machine (server/source) may be a usual Linux box or
   also using muLinux. Though its low transfer rate I use a serial null
   modem cable because its cheap. You may apply the appropriate method
   using a <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> network card and a crossover network
   cable or a HUB, or a parallel "null modem" cable and PLIP. As the basic
   protocol I used PPP, but you may also use SLIP. For the data-transfer I
   used <command>nc</command>. Note: this is an abbrevation for
   <command>netcat</command>, some distributions use this as the program
   name. You may use <command>ftp</command>, <command>tftp</command>,
   <command>rsh</command>, <command>ssh</command>, <command>dd</command>,
   <command>rcp</command>, <command>kermit</command>,
   <command>NFS</command>, <command>SMB</command> and other programs

<title>From a Second (Desktop) Machine With a Hard Disk Adapter</title>

<para>
   From Adam Sulmicki &lt;adam_AT_cfar.unc.edu&gt; I got this hint: Most but not
   all harddisks in laptops are removable, but this might be not an easy
   task. You could just buy one of those cheap 2.5" IDE converters/adapters
   which allow you to connect this harddisk temporarily to a desktop PC with IDE
   subsystem, and install Linux as usual using that PC. You may do so using
   the harddisk as the first IDE drive or besides as the second IDE drive.
   But then you need to be sure that the bootloader (e.g.
   <command>lilo</command>)
   writes to the right partition.
   Also you have to make sure that you use the same translation style as
   your laptop is going to use (i.e. LBA vs. LARGE vs. CHS ). 
   You will find additional information in the 
   <ulink url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Hard-Disk-Upgrade/index.html">Hard-Disk-Upgrade-HOWTO</ulink>. 
   You might copy an existing partition, but it is also possible to achieve a
   customized installation. Instead of a desktop PC you may use a
   second laptop, which may offer better features like a CD/DVD, to put the harddisk in.
</para>

<para>
   The most common adapter formats are 2.5" IDE adapters (Parallel ATA - PATA). As
   far as I know Serial ATA (SATA) harddisks are not available for laptops
   yet. But they could be attached to Serial ATA interfaces in a desktop PC
   even without an adapter (at least I guess, but I will verify this as soon
   as I have SATA equipment available). Some small subnotebooks feature
   1.8" harddisks with ZIF connectors. These connectors are ATA compatible,
   and IDE adaptors for them are available also.

<para>
   Since I don't have a laptop which comes with a <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym>
   <emphasis>floppy drive</emphasis> (for instance Toshiba Libretto 100), I
   couldn't check this method. Please see the chapter Booting from a

   Also I couldn't check whether booting from a <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym>
   <emphasis>harddisk</emphasis> is possible.
</para>

<para>
   Anyway, when you are able to boot from a floppy and the laptop provides
   a <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> slot, it should be possible to use different
   <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> cards to connect to another machine, to an

   Usually these methods are described in the documentation which is
   provided with the distribution.

<para>
   The Sony Vaio (PCG-Z600) comes with an external USB-Floppy and an
   external CD-ROM (PCMCIA). You can boot from the CD-ROM, but afterwards
   Linux doesn't recognize the same drive anymore so that you can't install
   from it. You'll have to add the bootparameter 
   <command>linux ide2=0x180,0x360</command> (or 0x180,0x386?) at the LILO boot prompt if
   you want Linux to recognize a PCMCIA CDROM after the kernel has booted.

   <ulink url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Install-From-ZIP.html">Install-From-Zip-HOWTO</ulink>
   <!-- FIXME the guide is from 1998 -->
   . Also I don't know how much these installation methods are supported by the
   Linux distributions or the micro Linuxes. I suppose you have to fiddle
   around a bit to get this working.
</para>

<para>
   From Jeremy Impson &lt;jdimpson_AT_acm.org&gt;: I installed Red Hat 6.1
   on a Libretto 50CT. It only has a PCMCIA floppy drive. (Which BTW isn't
   well supported by the default PCMCIA floppy driver. I needed to download
   a patch from some Linux on Libretto web site.)
</para>

<para>
   Linux will boot off the PCMCIA floppy drive, however. It just can't go
   back to the floppy after loading the kernel. My Libretto (the 50CT) only
   has one PCMCIA slot (later models had two slots, or I could have gotten
   the enhanced port replicator, which gave it another slot). So I couldn't
   boot off a floppy and then mount a remote filesystem.
</para>

<para>
   So I downloaded ZipSlack (Slackware designed for running from a ZIP
   disk) and used another PC to load it onto a ZIP disk. I attached the ZIP
   drive to the Libretto (via the parallel port on the regular port
   replicator that comes with it) and booted from the Slackware boot disk
   in the PCMCIA floppy drive. When booted, I removed the floppy drive and
   inserted and configured a network PCMCIA card. At this point the kernel
   is in memory and it is using the filesystem on the ZIP disk.
</para>

<para>
   I partitioned and formatted the Libretto's harddrive and then ftp'd Red
   Hat 6.1 installation source onto one of the new partitions (the
   partition that would become <filename>/home</filename> when everything
   gets done). This is the key: if you don't have enough disk space to have
   the installation files plus enough to actually install the OS on to,
   this method won't work.
</para>

<para>
   I shut down the ZipSlack kernel and rebooted it using a RedHat install
   disk in the floppy drive. I pointed it at the RH6.1 installation media
   already on the harddrive and started the install.

<title>From a Parallel Port CD Drive (MicroSolutions BackPack)</title>

<para>
   I had tried myself to install Linux using the MicroSolutions BackPack
   parallel CD-ROM drive. It is fully supported by Linux and I haven't had
   any major problem running it. Until version 2.0.36 it is supported by
   its own module (<command>bpck</command>) while in later versions it
   has been merged in the more general parallel port ide adaptors (the
   <command>paride</command> module that relays then of course on more
   specific low level drivers, which in the BackPack case is still called
   <command>bpck</command>). 
</para>

<para>
   In RedHat 5.x based installations the <command>bpck</command> module is
   available already at installation stage so you'll just have to select
   the BackPack cdrom from the <emphasis>Other CD-ROMs</emphasis> at the
   installation stage and then give it some more options (but
   <command>autoprobe</command> should work just fine).
</para>

<para>
   In RedHat 6.x (which uses 2.2.x kernels and should then use 
   <command>paride</command>), the BackPack support was dropped. So to
   install the distribution from such a device, you will have to customize the
   bootdisk (adding the necessary modules) and the installation will be
   done without any problem.
</para>

<para>
   Federico Pellegrin has customized a RedHat bootdisk that includes all the
   parallel CDROM devices that are supported by the distribution Linux
   kernel version (2.2.12) that should then work on all the supported
   parallel CDROM devices (even if he only tested it on his MicroSolutions
   BackPack since he doesn't have other similar hardware). You can find
   <ulink url="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://sole.infis.univ.trieste.it/~drzeus/rh_pcd.html">some information on it and the bootdisk image</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
   As from RedHat 6.2 a supplementary driver disk was included in the
   distribution to support the paride devices. You'll just have to create
   the driver disk (the image file is <command>paride.img</command> and can
   be found in the <filename>images/drivers</filename> directory) in the
   usual way and insert it when the installer will ask for it.
</para>

<para>
   Of course I suppose there isn't any problem in installing any other
   Linux distribution using such a device as long as you can add and
   configure the appropriate modules at the very beginning of the
   installation stage, but I haven't tested any.
</para>

<para>
   You should take care of the mode the parallel port uses (ECP, EPP,
   Output only, PS/2) since some of them may cause your laptop to suddenly
   freeze or cause serious data corruption. On the other side some modes
   make the communication dramatically slow (I found the best choice on my
   laptop the PS/2, but you should make some tests).

<subtitle>PLIP Network Install</subtitle>

<para>
   I got this courtesy by Nathan Myers &lt;ncm_AT_cantrip.org&gt;: "Many
   distributions support installing via a network, using FTP, HTTP, or
   NFS. It is increasingly common for laptops to have only a single
   <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> slot, already occupied by the boot floppy
   drive. Usually the boot floppy image has drivers for neither the
   floppy drive itself, nor the <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> subsystem.
   Thus, the only network interface available may be the parallel port.
</para>

<para>
   Installation via the parallel port using the PLIP protocol has been
   demonstrated on, at least, Red Hat. All you need is a
   <emphasis>Laplink</emphasis> parallel cable, cheap at any computer
   store. See the 
   <ulink url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/PLIP.html">PLIP-HOWTO</ulink>
   for details on setting up the
   connection. Note that (uniquely) the RedHat installation requires that
   the other end of the PLIP connection be configured to use ARP
   (apparently because RedHat uses the DOS driver in their installer). On
   the host, either <command>export</command> your CD file system on NFS,
   or <command>mount</command> it where the ftp or web daemon can find it,

A common problem during Linux installation (or afterwards) on laptops are missing
lines at the bottom of the text console display, so the last command lines or the login prompt
are not shown on the screen. Depending on the problem it might help:

<title>Linux PDAs</title>

<para>
   The most known Linux PDAs in these days are the
   <ulink url="http://tuxmobil.org/pda_survey_agenda.html">Agenda VR3</ulink>
   by AgendaComputing (out-of-production), the 
   <ulink url="http://tuxmobil.org/pda_survey_compaq.html">iPAQ</ulink>
   by HP/COMPAQ, the
   <ulink url="http://tuxmobil.org/pda_survey_sharp.html">Zaurus series</ulink>
   by SHARP,
   and the <ulink url="http://tuxmobil.org/pda_survey_samsung.html">Yopy</ulink>
   by Samsung (out-of-production). Except the iPAQ all of them are true Linux PDAs, 
   they are pre-equipped with Linux by their manufacturers.
</para>

<para>
   There are different free distributions for Linux PDAs
   available, e.g.:
   <ulink url="http://www.trolltech.com/">QT Embedded</ulink> (pre-installed on the SHARP Zaurus),
   <ulink url="http://opie.handhelds.org/">Opie</ulink>,
   <ulink url="http://familiar.handhelds.org/">Familiar</ulink>.
   The 
   <ulink url="http://gpe.handhelds.org/">Gnome Palmtop Environment - GPE</ulink>
   aims to provide a Free Software GUI environment
   for palmtop/handheld computers running the GNU/Linux
   operating system. GPE uses the X Window System, and the GTK+
   widget toolkit.
</para>

<para>
   Most of the software for the newer PDAs can be obtained as pre-compiled
   IPK packages. You may search the
   <ulink url="http://www.killefiz.de/zaurus/">Zaurus Software Index - ZSI</ulink>
   or
   <ulink url="http://ipkgfind.handhelds.org/">ipkgfind</ulink> for the
   package you need.
   To install these packages you may choose different methods. One
   method is to install directly via a HTTP connection called
   <emphasis>feed</emphasis>. For an
   example see the
   <ulink url="http://tuxmobil.org/feed.html">TuxMobil IPK feed</ulink>.

   Besides these well-known Linux PDAs I will also try to point
   to ports for other PDAs and to tools to achieve connectivity to
   non-Linux PDAs, cell phones and desktop computers.

<title>The SHARP System</title>

<para>
   You may find the official site for information about Linux on the Zaurus at
   <ulink url="http://developer.ezaurus.com/">SHARP Japan</ulink> (in Japanese). 
   You can get the official kernel, either complete or just the patches for the
   Zaurus there. You can also get the official root-filesystem, that is the
   initrd, but without the 
   <ulink url="http://qpe.sourceforge.net/">QTopia</ulink>
   environment.
   
   Check the documentation at SHARP how to create your zImage, bootflag and
   initrd for flashing the ROM of the Zaurus with your custom setup. Or go to
   your country-specific division of SHARP to get a complete ROM in one file
   called "ospack", which is
   <ulink url="http://www.zaurus.de/">Zaurus.DE</ulink>
   for Germany or 
   <ulink url="http://www.myzaurus.com/">MyZaurus</ulink>
   for the US versions.
   
   The kernel is rather old: 2.4.6 with 2.4.6-rmk2-patches and some more from
   <ulink url="http://www.lineo.com/">Lineo</ulink>.
   The rmk-patches are from 
   <ulink url="http://www.arm.uk.linux.org/">Linux ARM Community</ulink>.
   The root filesystem from SHARP is known for its weird structure with
   symbolic links all over the place.
   
   The custom compile worked. Remember to hit the "/"-key when the Zaurus
   displays "Wait... ", so you can choose to start a login instead of QTopia,
   which is not available then. Unless you downloaded QTopia, (cross-)compiled
   it and installed it into the root filesystem.
   BTW, you can create a new user with "adduser", a command provided by BusyBox.
   <ulink url="http://www.busybox.org/">BusyBox</ulink>
   , provides nearly all UNIX-commands available on the official system.

<title>The Community Systems</title>

<para>
Currently I know of two running systems: OpenZaurus and Debian (unofficial).
</para>

<sect3>
<title>OpenZaurus</title>

<para>
   <ulink url="http://openzaurus.org/">OpenZaurus</ulink>
   tries to create the same environment as the one from SHARP, but
   based upon free software only.
   
   At the moment, it still uses the old kernel from Sharp, but slightly
   modified in regards of usage of the FLASH-ROM as RAM and division of RAM
   between RAMDISK and RAM. Unfortunately, the driver for the SD-controller is
   binary-only and thus non-free. But also SHARP itself tries to convince the
   vendor, SDCA, to provide the sources for the public.
   
   Moreover, 
   <ulink url="http://openzaurus.org/">OpenZaurus</ulink>
   created a sane root-filesystem we all know from our
   regular Linux systems. It also replaces QTopia by 
   <ulink url="http://opie.handhelds.org">Open Palmtop Integrated Environment - OPIE</ulink>
   , which
   is a fork from QTopia with no relations to Trolltech anymore. All
   applications from QTopia should run on OPIE, but not quite: The Doom-like
   game called Zraycast does not run on OPIE, but does on QTopia (more or less).
   
   You can download a ready zimage, bootflag and initrd directly or checkout the
   sources from CVS. The downloaded images worked fine.
</para>


</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Debian</title>

<para>
   The current, unofficial version of 
   <ulink url="http://people.debian.org/~mdz/zaurus/">Debian Zaurus</ulink>
   really tries to be a regular
   Debian system with apt and X. A simple version of dpkg is already shipped with
   <ulink url="http://www.busybox.org/">BusyBox</ulink>
   , which makes it a little bit easier. The maintainer has therefore
   stripped down some more tools to fit them into the Flash-ROM.
   It uses the kernel provided by 
   <ulink url="http://openzaurus.org/">OpenZaurus</ulink>
   and thus the one from Sharp.
   There are some issues with the RAMdisk, calibration of the stylus and
   sleep / power-off/-on.
   
   As soon as it is in a more stable state, it will join forces with 
   <ulink url="http://emdebian.sourceforge.net/">EmDebian</ulink>
   and the sources will become available (probably already furnished upon
   request). The downloaded images still have to be tweaked. :)
   
   All systems, including the sources from SHARP, are set to use the US
   keyboard layout (or the German keyboard). It seems that the keymap
   available is fixed in the kernel and there are no user-space tools
   installed per default to change this. Perhaps I will give the package
   "console-tools" on Debian a try.

<title>Synchronization with your Linux PC</title>

<para>
   The QTopia-Desktop is available as a download from 
   <ulink url="http://www.trolltech.com/developer/download/qtopia.html">Trolltech</ulink>
   for free (as in beer): There is a 
   <ulink url="http://docs.zaurus.com">FAQ</ulink>,
   which explains the necessary steps for setup (Ethernet-over-USB). It is not
   quite up-to-date, because SHARP has tightened the security with their current
   ROM-release, so you have to give the IP-address 192.168.129.1 to your usb0
   network device.  You have to download and compile a patch for your kernel
   to use the driver usbdnet (see aforementioned website). Afterwards, a
   connection between the QTopia-Desktop and the Zaurus is possible.
   I had a lot of problems with the usb network layer on my system and could not
   sync properly. A switch from the driver uhci to usb-uhci for my host dit it.
   Just recently I had to reboot my notebook and the Zaurus due to a hiccup in
   the corresponding usb-net drivers. The network via an ethernet-card in the
   CF-slot is much more reliable than the connection via usb and you can still
   use the keyboard. The disadvantage is, that you cannot have a storage device
   in your CF-slot while you are on-line.

<sect2>
<title>External Serial Keyboard</title>

<para>
   So far I was not able to get it going.  
   There is a site which offers a 
   <ulink url="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jpc1/linux/ipaq/serial.html">serial keyboard driver and a patch for the iPAQ</ulink>
   .  Since the iPAQ and the Zaurus are based on the same CPU architecture,
   StrongArm, I hope that the driver provided there will also work on the
   Zaurus.  You also need a user-space tool called
   <command>inputattach</command>, which you can also get from there (source
   or binary for ARM).  I got a Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite with a PS/2
   connector.  An adaptor translates to serial which itself is plugged into
   to the Collie serial &lt;-&gt; serial connector.  I do not know if this
   chain is even possible to work.  The provided patch applied with only one
   failing hunk which made a trivial change in the sources
   (include/linux/serio.h) necessary; check the output.  After having
   re-configured the SHARP kernel config and having compiled the modules, I
   transferred them to the Zaurus.  The modules marked and created are:
   newtonkbd.o, serio.o, serport.o and perhaps stowaway.o from
   drivers/char/joystick/ and input.o and keybdev.o from drivers/input/.
   When you start <command>inputattach</command>, you have to use the line
   <command>inputattach --newtonkbd /dev/ttyS0</command>, _not_ ttySA0 as
   stated on the website.  For some strange reason, the Collie serial driver
   does not comply to the official StrongARM documentation of the kernel,
   which states that the serial ports are accessible via /dev/ttySAx.  And
   because the serial_collie.o is already compiled into the Sharp kernel,
   you do not have to load the generic module serial.o.  Well, I also tried
   the serial_collie.o as a module, while it was still compiled into the
   kernel.  There were no complaints when loading it, but the system froze
   unpredictably, so I had to do a soft-reset quite often.  Why can I load a
   module whose code is already in the kernel, I wonder...  Anyway, it does
   not work.  :( I tried inputattach in the --dump mode (you have to
   undefine a variable in the source and recompile) and it seems that there
   is nothing happening between the serial port and the keyboard.  The call
   for select (man 2 select) fails due to a timeout.

<title>Kernel</title>

<para>
   In order to build the kernel, initrd and applications you need a
   cross-compiling environment, GCC is preferred.  
   <ulink url="http://emdebian.sourceforge.net/">EmDebian</ulink>
   offers
   .deb packages for Debian GNU/Linux i386.  
   
   Note: you have to look up the download
   links in the old site (a link is provided on the new site), because they are
   missing on the new site (though the download page exists).
   
   There are some
   dependancy problems with the g++ and libstdc++-dev packages which can be
   "resolved" with a --force-depends.  The package libstdc++-dev has some problems
   finding an info-file: just create a symlink from
   <filename>/usr/share/info/iostream.ifo.gz</filename>
   to <filename>/usr/share/info/iostream-295.info.gz</filename>.
   
   You should get some pointers for other systems at the 
   <ulink url="http://www.arm.uk.linux.org/">Linux ARM Community</ulink>.
   Once installed, you can grab a standard kernel, apply the current ARM-patches
   and modify the top Makefile to target the arm-architecture.  I did not try that
   so far.

<title>Caveats</title>

<para>
  SHARP introduced a proprietary serial interface at the bottom of the Zaurus
  SL-5x00 series.  You can buy an adaptor to a regular serial interface from them, but
  unfortunately, the plug is very thick and you cannot open the slide for the
  keyboard anymore. Hopefully, you can still plug an external keyboard into this port!
  You can at least plug the power cord into the adaptor so you do not have to
  run on battery. There are third-party adaptors available, which overcome
  this caveat.
</para>

<para>
  There is no speaker for the soundchip of the SL-5500. You have to use the socket for the
  headphones to hear OggVorbis and the alikes. The buzzer currently supports
  only 14 different sounds defined in 
  <filename>&lt;kernel-source&gt;/include/asm-arm/sharp_char.h</filename>

   "We (Nicolas Pitre and myself) have successfully ported BRLTTY to the iPaq
   and tested the setup by interfacing with a BrailleLite 18 through the
   serial port.
   
   BRLTTY is a program that allows access to the Linux text-mode console
   using various brands of Braille displays.
   
   The BrailleLite is a small electronic Braille notetaker device which can
   act as a small refreshable Braille display. It also has keys so I can not
   only read but also type.
   
   So there's just the iPaq and the BrailleLite device (with a horrible
   cable in between) and that's all I need to fully use the console on
   the iPaq (in text-mode). A pretty powerful setup, yet very small.
   
   At the Ottawa Linux Symposium in July, using a network card in my iPaq
   and borrowing the internet connection they supplied, I was actually able
   to logon to the net and go read my E-mail, using ssh, pine and lynx!
   
   It should be possible to duplicate this setup with other Braille display
   models or other PDAs."

<title>Tablet PCs / Pen PCs</title>

<sect1>
<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
   Tablet PCs are a special kind of notebooks. Usually without keyboard
   (or equipped with an external and remote keyboard), they feature a touchscreen
   (therefore they were also named Pen PCs) and access to wireless LAN.
   In a certain sense they can be compared with PDAs. Microsoft has
   created a special edition of their operating system for Tablet PCs
   and published a so-called specification. In 2003 the first Tablet PCs 
   according to this specification entered the market. Though there
   have been appropriate devices with Linux many years before. See the
   <ulink url="http://tuxmobil.org/touch_laptops.html">survey of Linux touch screen laptops</ulink>
   and the
   <ulink url="http://tuxmobil.org/detach_disp.html">survey of Linux laptops with detachable displays</ulink>
   and finally a
   <ulink url="http://tuxmobil.org/tablet_unix.html">survey about Linux on Tablet PCs, WebPads, NotePads and PenPCs</ulink>.
   They are used for data acquisition in stores, in the field or in
   hospitals. Or as a book reader or webbrowser (therefore they are also named
   WebPads). Their hardware features require some dedicated Linux
   solutions.

</para>

<para>
   If you run into unresolvable trouble when configuring the hardware,
   try a BIOS upgrade from the manufacturer. For this task you
   usually need one of the Microsoft so-called operating systems. Or
   at least a DOS disk or CD.
</para>


<para>
   Flashing BIOSes has become often quite complex as both DOS and floppies
   are fading away. Things aren't any easier when running exclusively
   GNU/Linux. Luckily, it is possible to 
   <ulink url="http://freshrpms.net/docs/bios-flash/">create a bootable CD-ROM</ulink>
   with GNU/Linux, which enables one to actually flash a BIOS using a DOS utility
   without requiring Windows, MS-DOS or a floppy drive.

   Some newer laptops e.g. ASUS M5200A are equipped with a BIOS, which
   is able to update itself.

<para>
   <ulink url="http://www.linuxbios.org">LinuxBIOS</ulink>
   aims to replace the normal BIOS found on PCs, Alphas, and
   other machines with a Linux kernel that can boot Linux from a cold
   start. LinuxBIOS is primarily Linux - about 10 lines of patches to the
   current Linux kernel.  Additionally, the startup code - about 500
   lines of assembly and 5000 lines of C - executes 16 instructions to
   get into 32-bit mode and then performs DRAM and other hardware
   initialization required before Linux can take over. There are
   even two reports about LinuxBIOS on laptops.

   name, serial number, BIOS version, asset tag as well as a lot of other
   details of varying level of interest and reliability depending on the
   manufacturer. This will often include usage status for the CPU sockets,
   expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI, ISA) and memory module slots, and the list
   of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel, USB).
</para>

<para>

   has the ability to obtain Dell system-specific information such as the
   Dell System ID number, service tag, and asset tag. Future plans include

<title>CPUFREQ</title>

   You might want to check into the 
   <ulink url="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/cpufreq/cpufreq.html">cpufreq</ulink>
   patch for the linux-2.4/2.5 kernels:
   
   CPU clock frequency scaling for Linux, on x86 and ARM based
   processors. This module provides a user-space and standard kernel-space
   interface to this feature, along ARM system-on-a-chip devices to cope
   with processor clock changes. 
   
   Since the power consumed by a processor is directly related to the
   speed at which it is running, keeping the clock speed as low as
   possible allows you to get more run-time out of your battery. Some
   people use this to adjust their clock speed many times a second to
   optimise performance vs battery life. See also the 
   <ulink url="http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/cvs/">CVS repository</ulink>
   .

<!--
   Certain processors have the facility to scale their
   voltage/clockspeed.  2.5 introduces an interface to this feature,
   see Documentation/cpufreq for more information. This functionality
   also covers features like Intel's speedstep, and will be extended
   in time to cover the Powernow feature present in mobile Athlons.

   A

   that will make your CPU run cooler? Sounds
   pretty strange, huh? Let me explain: Have you ever thought of the
   fact that your CPU is idle most of the time when you're using
   your computer? For example, when you're using your word
   processor, writing emails, browsing the web, the CPU does nothing
   else than just wait for user input. In fact, it will use up to
   30W and produce substantial amounts of heat doing
   nothing.
   
   Good operating systems, like Linux, NT and OS/2 have a
   so-called "idle loop" - a loop that's always executed when
   the CPU has nothing to do. This loop consists of halt
   (HLT) instructions. 
   
   CPUs like the AMD K6, the Cyrix 6x86 and 6x86MX have a
   special feature called "suspend-on-halt". This means
   that everytime the CPU executes a hlt instruction, it
   will go into "suspend mode" for a short time. So, while
   the idle loop is being executed, the CPU will be in
   suspend mode, use much less power, and stay much cooler.
   
   Of course, this does not affect performance at all!
   The user won't even notice that his CPU is in suspend
   mode most of the time (unless he touches the
   heatsink).

<title>Wireless LAN: PRO/wireless 2100/2200 LAN Mini-PCI Adapter</title>

<para>
   There are different solutions to get these cards running with Linux:

</para>

<para>
   <ulink url="http://ipw2100.sourceforge.net/">ipw2100</ulink>,
   Intel's Open Source driver with included firmware, for the first
   Centrino generation (incl. WEP and WPA together with HostAP).
   
   For the second generation of Intel's miniPCI modules: PRO/Wireless
   2200BG (802.11g/802.11i), the 
   <ulink url="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/">ipw2200</ulink>
   project provides a driver.
   
   Third generation PRO/Wireless 2915ABG (IEEE 802.11b, 802.11g und
   802.11a) miniPCI cards will be supported by the
   <ulink url="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/">ipw2200</ulink>
   project, too.
</para>

<para>
   Intel didn't provide drivers, when the begun to sell their Centrino
   technology. During this time there have been other solutions:

   Some vendors refuse to release technical specifications or even a binary Linux driver
   for their WLAN cards. NDIS wrapper tries to solve this by making a kernel
   module that can load NDIS (Microsoft-Windows Network Driver Interface
   Specification) drivers. Currently there are two implementations available.
   The commercial
   <ulink url="http://www.linuxant.com/driverloader/">Linuxant Driverloader</ulink>
   supports a broad range of chipsets including Intel's PRO/Wireless 2100 LAN
   Mini-PCI Adapter. There is also 
   <ulink url="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/">ndiswrapper</ulink>
   an Open Source solution by Pontus Fuchs.
</para>

<para>
   As another workaround was the usage of a Linux-supported
   <ulink url="http://tuxmobil.org/minipci_linux.html">miniPCI WLAN card</ulink>.
   These cards are difficult to get, but some desktop WLAN PCI cards contain miniPCI cards. Often it is a tedious task to
   build them into a laptop. Kernel maintainer Theodore Tytso has written a 
   <ulink url="http://www.thunk.org/tytso/linux/t40.html">manual</ulink> about achieving this task. You may also
   use a wireless PCMCIA or CF card
   instead. This solution may provide more flexibility, because you may use a PCMCIA or
   CF card in different devices and choose the Linux driver of your choice. You may also extend the wireless range by
   adding antennas to some cards. For Linux compatibility there is the 
   <ulink url="http://tuxmobil.org/pcmcia_linux.html">TuxMobil PCMCIA/CF Card Survey</ulink>.
   In the future, manufacturers will probably offer alternative miniPCI solutions. DELL is already doing so for their
   Latitude D series.

<title>Conclusion</title>

<para>
   Though Linux support is not yet complete, some features of the Centrino(TM) technology already make it worthwhile to
   take into account when buying your next laptop. Though the new CPUs are named so similarly to existing ones that some
   people mix them up, they are completely different inside. Compared to the Pentium-4 Mobile CPU, the Pentium-M will
   allow a smaller form factor for laptops, making them more portable and lighter. Because of their higher clockspeed,
   the Pentium-4 CPUs have produced too much heat to build them into slimline notebook cases. Therefore, very flat
   notebooks have only been available from Apple or with a Pentium III Mobile CPU. Also, the battery power the Pentium-M
   consumes for a given level of performance will decrease, but I do not have a benchmark about how much the savings
   actually are yet. PENN Computing offers a nice 
   <ulink url="http://www.upenn.edu/computing/provider/docs/centrinoprovider.html">comparison of Pentium-M and Pentium-4 Mobile</ulink>.
   Note: The character M in Pentium-M suggests "mobile". Therefore some people mix
   this kind of CPU with the mobile versions of the Pentium-III/Pentium-4 CPU.

<title>Power Management for Graphics Cards</title>

<para>
The uptime on batteries can be improved by enabling the power management
features of the graphics card. There are tools available to change the clock
frequency and to shut down the backlight of the display. Usually these tools
are specific for a graphics card or a graphics card manufacturer.
Here are some techniques for graphics cards made by ATI.

</para>

<para>
After rebooting or re-starting X11 you can start the power save mode with the
command <command>aticonfig --set-powerstate=1 --effective=now</command>.
Use <command>aticonfig --list-powerstates</command> to get all available
powerstates.
</para>

<para>
For ATI Radeon graphics cards the <command>rovclock</command> tool can be used
to save power e.g. <command>rovclock -c 80 -m 80</command> to use only 80MHz chip
and memory frequency. The command <command>radeontool light off</command>
switches the backlight off, if closing the lid or using an extra key is not an
option.

<!--

   Why is this in the compatibility check?
   what about keyboard misbehaviour as mentioned in the
   SuSE SDB?

-->

   Usually there are no problems with Linux and the keyboard.
   Though there are two minor caveats: First the
   <command>setleds</command> program might not work. Second the
   key mapping might not fit your needs. Some
   <acronym>UNIX</acronym> users and <command>vi</command> users
   expect to find the &lt;CONTROL&gt; key to the left of the
   &lt;A&gt; key. Many PC-type keyboards have the
   &lt;CAPS-LOCK&gt; key there. You may use
   <command>xmodmap</command> or <command>loadkeys</command> to
   re-map the keyboard. Some laptops (e.g., Toshiba) allow you
   to swap the &lt;CAPS-LOCK&gt; and &lt;CONTROL&gt; keys. Mark
   Alexander offered this solution in the linux-laptop mailing
   list: On RedHat, it's a one-line patch to
   <filename>/usr/lib/kbd/keytables/us.map</filename> , or
   whatever file is referenced in

<title>External USB Keyboard Configuration</title>

<para>
   You may not need any operating system support at all to use a

   several <acronym>BIOS</acronym> available where the
   <acronym>BIOS</acronym> can provide <acronym>USB</acronym> support from
   a keyboard plugged into the root hub on the motherboard. This may or may
   not work through other hubs and does not normally work with add-in
   boards, so you might want to add in support anyway. You definitely want
   to add keyboard support if you activate operating system support, as the
   Linux <acronym>USB</acronym> support will disable the
   <acronym>BIOS</acronym> support. You also need to use Linux
   <acronym>USB</acronym> keyboard support if you want to use any of the
   "multimedia" types keys that are provided with some
   <acronym>USB</acronym> keyboards.
</para>

<para>

   serial port adapter: Many people have dreamed having their SUN Type 5 keyboard
   attached to their Linux box up to now. And with this adapter,
   it is finally possible. Because the standard SUN keyboards
   use TTL RS232 at 1200 bps to talk to the SUNs, it's very easy
   to make them talk to any non-SUN computer by converting this
   to true RS232. All what you need is a MAX232 chip that'll
   take care about the correct voltage levels, and also some
   chip to invert the signals (CD4049 in the pic, I've used a
   7400 quad-nand myself), since the MAX232 inverts them as
   well, and we don't need this. This all easily fits into a
   25-pin serial connector.
</para>
   removed because not related specifically to mobile computers,

   Some laptops offer extra buttons, e.g. - internet, mail keys, or
   zone keys. If the Linux kernel and XFree86/X.org generate key codes for
   them, <command>hotkeys</command> or just plain
   <command>xmodmap</command> (see the man page of this X11 programm
   for details) may be helpful. If Linux doesn't know
   about the keys, you'll have to patch the kernel first.

   Though I'm not quite sure some tools don't seem 
   to require this, I don't understand how it works yet.

   <ulink url="http://www.geocities.com/wmalms/">xhkeys</ulink>
   . This tool allows you to assign an

   "menu" key on a 105 key keyboard, extra keys on some keyboard
   models, or odd keys on laptops). The action assigned to a key
   or key combination (key and modifiers) can be a builtin
   operation, a call to an external application, the sending of a
   key event (simulating a key press/release), or the sending of a
   mouse button event (simulating a button press/release).

<title>Function Key</title>

<para> 
   The function key (often labelled Fn on the key) is usually used to
   switch on a simulated numeric keyboard, which is provided as a separate
   keypad on desktop keyboards. For those who don't want to use the
   simulation there are additional external numeric keypads
   available for PS/2 ports and I suppose USB ports.
   
   Also the function key may be used in combination with some F-keys to
   change display brightness, adjust the speaker volume or mute them,
   lock the keyboard, switch between external and internal display, use
   different suspend modes and more.  Sometimes these key combinations
   work out of the box with Linux. Some require dedicated tools, for
   these tools see the Hotkey chapter above.

<title>Numeric Keypad</title>

<para>
   On desktop keyboards the numeric keypad is usually separated from
   the character set, but laptops don't have a separated numeric keypad.
   There are different ways to emulate one,
   e.g. with the <command>Fn</command> key or with <command>NUM-LOCK</command>
   key. Also external numeric keyboards which connect
   to the PS/2 port (or USB, RS232) are available.

   if you want to change the X11 resolution by typing
   <command>&lt;CTL&gt;&lt;ALT&gt;&lt;+&gt;</command> or
   <command>&lt;CTL&gt;&lt;ALT&gt;&lt;-&gt;</command>.
   If this doesn't work or is too complicated, you may use
   <ulink url="http://www.dakotacom.net/~donut/programs/gvidm.html">gvidm</ulink>
   Running <command>gvidm</command> will pop up a list of available modes and allows the user
   to select one if desired. This makes it perfect for running from an
   application menu or a hotkey, so you don't have to use ram for an applet
   constantly running. If you are running dual or multi-head displays, it
   will give you a list of screens so you can select the appropriate one.
   Also you may use <command>xvidtune [-next | -prev ]</command>. To check
   the current resolution you may use <command>xwininfo -root</command>,
   if <command>xvidtune</command> is not at hand.

   How to use <command>tpconfig</command>: <command>tpconfig</command> is

</listitem>

<listitem>

<para>
   if the finger moves close to an edge then the mouse motion will be

   It seems <command>gpm</command> is best known as a console biased tool.
   This is true, but you may use it as an X11 input device.
   <command>gpm</command> is used as a repeater device. In this way you can
   use both the built-in synaptics touchpad with all the features and at
   the same time a serial mouse (with three buttons). This all works
   smoothly together. X11 reads the mouse events from a named pipe
   <filename>/dev/gpmdata</filename> in a protocol it understands, which in
   my case is <emphasis>Mouse-Systems-Compatible</emphasis> (5bytes). Most
   3-button mice use the default protocol. So a simple reconfiguration in
   XF86Config is all that is required, after starting
   <command>gpm</command> in an appropriate way, of course.

   <command>gpm</command> could be started on your laptop with the

   and X11 mode. You do have to create the named pipe
   <filename>/dev/gpmdata</filename> yourself.

-->

<para>
   For better handling, e.g. with a 3 button mouse you may use an external
   mouse. This is usually a serial mouse or a PS/2 mouse, or in our days a USB
   mouse, appropriate to the port your laptop offers. Usually this is no
   problem. The only thing I currently don't know a solution for is the
   automagic detection of a newly plugged in mouse from X11. To get it work
   you have to restart your X server.
</para>

<sect3>
<title>PS/2 Mouse</title>

<para>
   For PS/2 ports there are so called Y-Cable available, which make it
   possible to use external mouse and external keyboard at the same time if
   your laptop supports this feature.
</para>

<warning>
<para>
   Don't plug in the external mouse while powered up. If you have
   separate mouse and keyboard ports, make sure you plug the mouse in the
   mouse port and the keyboard in the keyboard port. If you don't, you may
   have to do a hard reboot of the laptop to get it to recover.

<title>USB Mouse</title>

<para>
   This part is taken from The Linux <acronym>USB</acronym> Sub-System by
   Brad Hards.
</para>

<sect4>
<title>USB Human Interface Device (HID) Configuration</title>

<sect5>
<title>General HID Configuration</title>

<para>
   There are two options for using a <acronym>USB</acronym> mouse or a
   <acronym>USB</acronym> keyboard - the standalone Boot Protocol way and
   the full featured HID driver way. The Boot Protocol way is generally
   inferior, and this document describes the full featured way. The Boot
   Protocol way may be appropriate for embedded systems and other systems
   with resource constraints and no real need for the full keyboard and
   mouse capabilities.
</para>

<para>
   It is important to remember that the HID driver handles those devices
   (or actually those interfaces on each device) that claim to comply with
   the Human Interface Device (HID) specification. However the HID
   specification doesn't say anything about what the HID driver should do
   with information received from a HID device, or where the information
   that is sent to a device comes from, since this is obviously dependent
   on what the device is supposed to be doing, and what the operating
   system is. Linux (at the operating system kernel level) supports four
   interfaces to a HID device - keyboard, mouse, joystick and a generic
   interface, known as the event interface.
</para>

</sect5>

<sect5>
<title>HID Mouse Configuration</title>

<para>
   In the kernel configuration stage, you need to turn on
   <acronym>USB</acronym> Human Interface Device (HID) support and Mouse
   Support Do not turn on <acronym>USB</acronym> HIDBP Mouse support.
   Perform the normal kernel rebuild and installation steps. If you are
   installing as modules, you need to load the
   <filename>input.o</filename>, <filename>hid.o</filename> and
   <filename>mousedev.o</filename> modules.
</para>

<para>
   Plug in a <acronym>USB</acronym> mouse and check that your mouse has
   been correctly sensed by the kernel. If you don't have a kernel message,
   look for the changes to <filename>/proc/bus/usb/devices</filename>.
</para>

<para>
   Since <acronym>USB</acronym> supports multiple identical devices, you
   can have multiple mice plugged in. You can get each mouse seperately, or
   you can get them all mixed together. You almost always want the mixed
   version, and that is what will be used together. You need to set up a
   device node entry for the mixed mice. It is customary to create the
   entries for this device in the /dev/input/ directory.
</para>

<para>
Use the following commands: 

<programlisting role="small">
mkdir /dev/input
mknod /dev/input/mice c 13 63
</programlisting>

</para>

<tip>
<para>
   If you are unsure whether you are configuring the right mouse device,
   use <command>cat /dev/input/mice</command> (or other appropriate
   devices names). In case you do this for the correct mouse, you should see some
   bizarre looking characters as you move the mouse or click any of the
   buttons. 
<!--
   FIXME
   there are other mouse devices, e.g. USB
   has GPM to be stopped?
   cat </dev/input/mice ?
   weird language, could be more clear
-->
</para>
</tip>

<para>
   If you want to use the mouse under X, you have various options. Which
   one you select is dependent on what version of XFree86 you are using and
   whether you are using only <acronym>USB</acronym> for your mouse (or
   mice), or whether you want to use a <acronym>USB</acronym> mouse and
   some other kind of pointer device.
</para>

<para>
   You need to edit the <filename>XF86Config</filename> file (usually
   <filename>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config</filename> or
   <filename>/etc/X11/XF86Config</filename>).
</para>

<para>
   If you are using XFree86 version 4.0 or later, add an
   InputDevice section that looks like the following: 

<programlisting role="small">
Section "InputDevice"
     Identifier  "USB Mice"
     Driver      "mouse"
     Option      "Protocol"   "IMPS/2"
     Option      "Device"     "/dev/input/mice"
EndSection
</programlisting>

   or, if you want to use a wheel mouse, something like this may be more useful: 

<programlisting role="small">
Section "InputDevice"
     Identifier  "USB Mice"
     Driver      "mouse"
     Option      "Protocol"   "IMPS/2"
     Option      "Device"     "/dev/input/mice"
     Option      "ZAxisMapping"   "4 5"
     Option      "Buttons"        "5"
EndSection
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
   Consult the 
   <ulink url="http://www.xfree86.org/current/mouse.html">current XFree86 documentation</ulink>
   for a detailed explanation and more examples.
</para>

<para>
   You also need to add an entry to each applicable ServerLayout Section.
   These are normally at the end of the configuration file. If you only have
   a <acronym>USB</acronym> mouse (or <acronym>USB</acronym> mice), then
   replace the line with the "CorePointer" entry with the following line: 

<programlisting role="small">
InputDevice "USB Mice" "CorePointer"
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
   If you want to use both a <acronym>USB</acronym> mouse (or
   <acronym>USB</acronym> mice) and some other kind of pointer device,
   then add (do not replace) the following line to the applicable
   ServerLayout sections:

<programlisting role="small">
InputDevice "USB Mice" "SendCoreEvents"
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
   If you are using only a <acronym>USB</acronym> mouse (or
   <acronym>USB</acronym> mice) with XFree86 3.3, edit the Pointer
   section so that it looks like the following: 

<programlisting role="small">
Section "Pointer"
    Protocol    "IMPS/2"
    Device      "/dev/input/mice"
EndSection
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
   If you are trying to use a <acronym>USB</acronym> mouse (or
   <acronym>USB</acronym> mice) in addition to another pointer type
   device with XFree86 3.3, then you need to use the XInput
   extensions. Keep the existing Pointer (or modify it as required for
   the other device if you are doing an initial installation), and add
   the following entry (anywhere sensible, ideally in the Input
   devices area): 

<programlisting role="small">
Section "Xinput"
   SubSection "Mouse"
  DeviceName   "USB Mice"
  Protocol     "IMPS/2"
  Port         "/dev/input/mice"
  AlwaysCore
   EndSubSection
EndSection
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
   Restart the X server. If you don't have any mouse support at this point,
   remember that Ctrl-Alt-F1 will get you a virtual terminal that you can
   use to kill the X server and start debugging from the error messages.
</para>

<para>
   If you want to use the mouse under gpm, run (or kill and restart if it
   is already running) gpm with the following options. <command>gpm -m
   /dev/input/mice -t imps2</command> (as superuser). You can make
   this the default if you edit the initialisation files. These are
   typically named something like rc.d and are in
   <filename>/etc/rc.d/</filename> on RedHat distributions.
</para>

<para>
   If you have both a <acronym>USB</acronym> mouse (or
   <acronym>USB</acronym> mice) and some other kind of pointer device, you
   may wish to use gpm in repeater mode. If you have a PS/2 mouse on
   /dev/psaux and a <acronym>USB</acronym> mouse (or <acronym>USB</acronym>
   mice) on /dev/input/mice, then the following <command>gpm</command>
   command would probably be appropriate: <command>gpm -m /dev/input/mice
   -t imps2 -M -m /dev/psaux -t ps2 -R imps2</command>. Note that this will
   make the output appear on <filename>/dev/gpmdata</filename>, which is a
   FIFO and does not need to be created in advance. You can use this as the
   mouse "device" to non-X programs, and both mice will work together.

<title>Kernel Support</title>

<para>
   You need a kernel that has the <acronym>APM</acronym> driver compiled
   in using the appropriate kernel configuration options.
   Currently most distributions do not ship kernels with the
   <acronym>APM</acronym> driver enabled so you may have to enable the
   driver using a boot option or to compile a custom kernel.

   or your distribution manual for details.

<para>
   The <acronym>APM</acronym> driver can be modularized but this is

   (RTC) chip.  Apmsleep can be used to set the alarm time in the RTC and to go
   into suspend or standby mode. An  interrupt  from  the  RTC  causes the
   computer to wake-up.  The program detects this event, by waiting for a
   leap  in  the kernel  time  and terminates successfully. If no time leap
   occurs within one minute, or something  goes wrong, the exit value will
   be non-zero. Apmsleep is part of the <command>apmd</command> package.

   If your machine worked with 2.0.x kernels but not with the 2.2.x series,
   take this advice from Klaus Franken kfr_AT_klaus.franken.de : "The
   default changed in 2.2. Search in the init-scripts for
   <command>halt</command> and change it to <command>halt -p</command> or
   <command>poweroff</command>. See <command>man halt</command> , if you
   don't have this option you need a newer version of

   &quot;Card Services can be compiled with support for
   <acronym>APM</acronym> (Advanced Power Management) if you've configured
   your kernel with <acronym>APM</acronym> support. ...  The
   <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> modules will automatically be configured for
   <acronym>APM</acronym> if a compatible version is detected on your

   <command>cardctl suspend</command> before suspending your laptop, and
   <command>cardctl resume</command> after resuming, to cleanly shut down
   and restart your <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> cards.  This will not work

   Some machines have <acronym>APM</acronym> firmware that fails to save

   Sometimes X and <acronym>APM</acronym> don't work smoothly together.
   The machine might even hang. A recommendation from Steve Rader:
   Some linux systems have their X11 server hang when doing
   <command>apm -s</command>. Folks with this affliction might want to switch
   to the console virtual terminal and then suspend 
   <command>chvt 1; apm -s</command> as root, or, more appropiately 
   <command>sudo chvt 1; sudo apm -s</command>. I have these commands in a script, say,
   <command>my-suspend</command> and then do 
   <command>xapmload --click-command my-suspend</command> .

<title>Software Suspend</title>

<para>
   <ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/swsusp">Software suspend</ulink>
   enables the possibility of suspending a machine. It doesn't need APM.
   You may suspend your machine by either pressing Sysrq-d or with
   <command>swsusp</command> or <command>shutdown -z</command> (patch for
   <command>sysvinit</command> needed). It creates an image which is
   saved in your active swaps. By the next booting the kernel detects the
   saved image, restores the memory from it and then it continues to run
   as before you've suspended. If you don't want the previous state to
   continue use the <command>noresume</command> kernel option. 
</para>

<para>
   Software suspends may even be better than hibernate, because now I can
   suspend my Linux system, boot into Microsoft Windows, perform a few
   illegal operations and be shut down, and then restart my Linux setup
   exactly where I left off! This is something that cannot be done with
   hibernation, since that always restores the last state that you
   suspended from, be it Microsoft Windows or Linux. So if I want to switch
   to Microsoft Windows to play games or do anything else, I can leave my
   Linux desktop exactly as it is and return to how I left it.
</para>


<para>
   In recent 2.6 kernels SoftWareSuspend is part of the kernel. You may
   find it in the section Power Management. But there are also
   backports to 2.4 available.

   Machek back in 1998, three different implementations have been created for the

<ulink url="http://www.linuxpowertop.org/index.php"></ulink> project provides information on reducing power usage, tips, and tricks for Intel-based computers running Linux.
As a first step, Intel has released PowerTOP, a tool that helps you find what
software is using the most power. By fixing (or closing) these applications or
processes, you can immediately see the power savings in the tool. You'll also
see the estimated time left for battery power if you are running a laptop. The
Tips &amp; Tricks page has fixes for a lot of the issues that are already found.

<title>Memory</title>

<para>
   Unfortunately some laptops come with
   proprietary memory chips. So they are not
   interchangeable between different models. But
   this seems changing. With some models it's very
   difficult to install the memory if you have to
   open the case in detail. But this is also
   changing. Places were the memory can be changed
   easily are dedicated maintenance cover on the
   backside or often if you only have to remove
   the keyboard.

<title>Definitions</title>

<para>
   First some definitions. There is a difference between <emphasis>docking
   station</emphasis> and <emphasis>port replicator</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
   I use the term <emphasis>docking station</emphasis> for a box which
   contains slots to put some interface cards in, and space to put a
   harddisk, etc. in. This box can be permanently connected to a PC. A
   <emphasis>port replicator</emphasis> is just a copy of the laptop ports
   which may be connected permanently to a PC.
</para>


</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Other Solutions</title>

<para>
   I don't use a docking station myself. They seem really expensive and I can't
   see any usefulness. Alright you have to deal with some more cables, but is
   it worth so much money? Docking stations are useful in an office
   environment when you have a permanent network connection, or need the
   docking station's expansion bus slots (e.g. for some excotic SCSI device).
</para>

<para>
   Also all docking stations I know are proprietary models, so if you
   change your laptop you have to change this device, too. I just found
   one exception a docking station which connects to your laptop via
   <trademark class="registered">IrDA</trademark> the IRDocking IR-660 by 
   <ulink url="http://www.tekram.com/">Tekram</ulink>
   . It supports these connectors: 10Base-T (RJ-45); PS/2 Keyboard; PS/2
   Mouse; 25-Pin Printer Port (LPT); IR Transceiver; Power (6 VDC). So it
   seems that a VGA port and a port to connect a desktop PC directly are
   missing. This device should work with Linux/<trademark
   class="registered">IrDA</trademark>, though I couldn't check it out.
</para>

<para>
   I would prefer to buy a PC instead and connect it via
   <emphasis>network</emphasis> to the laptop.
</para>

<para>
   Or use an external display, which usually works well as described above,
   and an external keyboard and mouse. If your laptop supports an extra
   PS/2 port you may use a cheap solution a <emphasis>Y-cable</emphasis>,
   which connects the PS/2 port to an external keyboard and an external
   monitor. Note: Your laptop probably has support for the <emphasis>Y-cable</emphasis>
   feature, e.g. the COMPAQ Armada 1592DT.

   "The main problem with docking stations is getting the operating
   system to detect you are docked. Fortunately, 
   you can examine the devices available in <filename>/proc</filename>
   and thus detect a docked state. With
   this in mind a few simple scripts is all you need to get your machine
   configured correctly in a docked state.
</para>

<para>
   You may want to build support for the docking station hardware as
   modules instead of putting it directly into the kernel. This will save
   space in your kernel but your choice probably largely depends on how
   often you are docked.
</para>

<para>
   1) Supporting <emphasis>additional disks</emphasis> on the docking
   station SCSI card
</para>

<para>
   To my mind the best way of doing this is to:
</para>

<para>

<orderedlist>

<listitem>

<para>
   Either build support for the SCSI card into the kernel or build it as a module.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
   Put the mount points into <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> but use the
   "noauto" flag to prevent them from being mounted automatically with the
   <command>mount -a</command> flag. In this way, when you are docked you
   can explicitly mount the partitions off any disk connected to the
   docking station SCSI card.
</para>

</listitem>

</orderedlist>

</para>

<para>
   2) Supporting <emphasis>additional network adaptors</emphasis> in the docking station
</para>

<para>
   You can use a similar method to that outlined above for the graphics
   card. Check the <filename>/proc</filename> filesystem in your rc scripts
   to see if you are docked and then set up your network connections
   appropriately. "
</para>

<para>
   Once you determine this information, you may use a script, similar to
   the following example, to configure the connection to your docking
   station at startup. The script is provided by Friedhelm Kueck:

<title>Universal USB Port Replicators</title>

<para>
I have used a Typhoon USB 2.0 7in1 Docking Station made by 
<ulink url="http://www.anubisline.com/">Anubis</ulink>
P/N 83057 to check the Linux compatibility of such devices. Actually
this device should be named port replicator, because it does not have
any extension slots. 
This device doesn't have a VGA port to connect to an external
display. Only a few USB docking stations have this feature. It would
be nice to get a report whether a VGA port works or not.
Tested with laptop COMPAQ M700 (USB 1.1) and custom made kernel 2.6.1.
Note the port replicator didn't work with
an Apple PowerBook G4.

<title>Modem Types</title>

<para>
   There are three kinds of modems available: internal,
   <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> card or external serial port modems. But
   some internal modems will not work with Linux these modems are usually
   called WinModem. This is caused by non-standard hardware. So you have to use either a
   <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> card modem or an external modem (serial or USB). The 
   <ulink url="http://walbran.org/sean/linux/linmodem-howto.html">LinModem-HOWTO</ulink>
   by Sean Walbran provides a detailed instruction how to deal 
   with these kind of modems. My pages about 
   <ulink url="http://tuxmobil.org/modem_linux.html">Internal Modems in Laptops</ulink> 
   and 
   <ulink url="http://tuxmobil.org/minipci_linux.html">miniPCI Devices in Laptops</ulink>
   provide a survey about the modem controllers used in different laptops.
</para>

<para>
   Quotation from the Kernel-FAQ: "9.Why aren't WinModems supported? (REG,
   quoting Edward S. Marshall) The problem is the lack of specifications
   for this hardware. Most companies producing so-called
   <emphasis>WinModems</emphasis> refuse to provide specifications which
   would allow non-Microsoft operating systems to use them. The basic
   issue is that they don't work like a traditional modem; they don't
   have a DSP, and make the CPU do all the work. Hence, you can't talk
   to them like a traditional modem, and you -need- to run the modem
   driver as a realtime task, or you'll have serious data loss issues
   under any kind of load. They're simply a poor design."
</para>

<para>
   "<emphasis>Win</emphasis> modems are lobotomized modems which expect
   Windows to do some of their thinking for them. If you do not have
   Windows, you do not have a connection. "

   Anyway, I have set up a page collecting information on laptops with internal modems at 
   <ulink url="http://tuxmobil.org/hardware.html">TuxMobil - Hardware</ulink>

<title>Caveats</title>

<warning>

<para>
   Pay attention to the different kinds of phone lines: analog and ISDN.
   You can't connect an analog modem to an ISDN port and vice versa. Though
   there might be hybrid modems available. Connecting to the wrong port may
   even destroy your modem. Trick: If you are looking for an analog phone
   port in an office building which is usually wired with ISDN, take a look
   at the fax lines, they are often analog lines.
</para>

   enough for some kind of devices, e.g. Web Cams or hard disks. But it seems to depend
   on the laptop and the specific device. With desktop Linux machines these
   USB devices work flawlessly, but with mobile devices not.

<title>FireWire - IEEE1394 - i.Link</title>

<para>
   Firewire, also known as IEEE-1394 and iLink, is a high-speed serial
   bus system that was originally developed by Apple Computer.
   Currently, its widest implementation is for digital video; however,
   it has a lot of other uses. Like USB, Firewire is a serial protocol
   that supports hot-swapping. Firewire supports much higher speeds
   than USB. The 
   <ulink url="http://linux1394.sourceforge.net/">Linux IEEE 1394 Subsystem</ulink>
   provides support for IEEE 1394 (FireWire, i.Link). 
   It consists of a kernel subsystem as well as applications.

   Usually there are no problems connecting a floppy drive to a Linux
   laptop. But with a laptop floppy drive you may sometimes not be able to
   use every feature. I encountered the <command>superformat</command>
   command (from the fdutils package) couldn't format more than 1.44MB with
   my HP OmniBook 800. You may also have difficulty when the floppy drive
   and CD drive are mutually exclusive, or when the floppy drive is a
   <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> device (as with the Toshiba Libretto 100).
   With older laptops, there might be a minor problem if they use a 720K
   drive. As far as I know all distributions come with support for 1.44M
   (and sometimes 1.2M) floppies only. Though it's possible to install
   Linux anyway. Please see Installation chapter. Please see kernel

<para>
   Most notebooks today come with CD drives. If floppy and CD drive are
   swappable they are usually mutually exclusive, however many vendors (HP,
   Dell) provide cables which allow the floppy module to be connected to
   the parallel port.  Sometimes the CD drives comes as external
   <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> device (e.g. SONY), or as SCSI device (e.g. HP
   OmniBook 800), USB device (e.g. SONY), or as Firewire (e.g. SONY VAIO
   VX71P).  Such an external devices might bear problems to install Linux
   from it.
</para>

<para>
   As far as I know there are SONY DiscMans available which have a port to
   connect them to a computer or even a SCSI port. I found an article

   With the command <command>cardctl ident</command> you may get information

   create a file <filename>/etc/pcmcia/&lt;MYCARD&gt;.conf</filename> appropriately.
   Take an entry in the first file as a model. You may try every driver, just in
   case it might work, for instance the <command>pcnet_cs</command>
   supports many NE2000 compatible <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> network cards.
   Note: it is a bad practice to edit <filename>/etc/pcmcia/config</filename>
   directly, because all changes will be lost with the next update.

   restart the PCMCIA services.

   Disconnect the external drive and then plug it in again.

   Or use an AC adapter to power the external drive. Though this seems
   unconvenient in a suspend situation. But since the external drive
   gets the power from the adapter, there is no disconnection from

<title>Bags and Suitcases</title>

<para>
   You probably wonder, why I include this topic here. But shortly after
   using my COMPAQ Armada 1592DT I recognized that the rear side of the
   machine (where the ports are arranged) was slightly damaged. Though I
   have taken much care when transporting the laptop, this was caused by
   putting the bag on the floor. It seems that the laptop has so much
   weight, that it bounces inside the bag on its own rear side. So I
   decided to put a soft pad into the bag before loading the laptop. A good
   bag is highly recommended if you take your laptop on trips, or take it
   home every night.
</para>

<para>
   Laptops computers are frequently demolished in their carrying bag. The
   two main causes of demolition are poking the LC display and banging the
   edges. A good case has very stiff sides to spread out pokes, and lots of
   energy-absorbent padding around the edges to help when you whack it on
   the door jamb. Few cases actually have either of these features.

   <quote>
   PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) is an
   international standards body and trade association with over 200 member companies
   that was founded in 1989 to establish standards for Integrated Circuit cards and to
   promote interchangeability among mobile computers where ruggedness, low power,
   and small size were critical. As the needs of mobile computer users have changed, so
   has the PC Card Standard. By 1991, PCMCIA had defined an I/O interface for the
   same 68 pin connector initially used for memory cards. At the same time, the Socket
   Services Specification was added and was soon followed by the Card Services
   Specifcation as developers realized that common software would be needed to
   enhance compatibility.
   </quote>
   The cards are available in different formats: Type I, II, III.
</para>

<para>
   A quotation from the <filename>../Documentation/Changes</filename> file:
   "PCMCIA (PC Card) support is now partially implemented in the main
   kernel source. Pay attention when you recompile your kernel.  If you
   need to use the <command>PCMCIA-CS</command> modules, then don't compile
   the kernel's PCMCIA support. If you don't need to use the PCMCIA-CS
   modules (i.e. all the drivers you need are in the kernel sources), then
   don't compile them; you won't need anything in there.  Also, be sure to
   upgrade to the latest <command>PCMCIA-CS</command> release." Further
   information you may get from the README-2.4 included with this package.

   Kernel Support for Hot-Plugable Devices

<programlisting role="small">
CONFIG_HOTPLUG
  Say Y here if you want to plug devices into your computer while
  the system is running, and be able to use them quickly. In many
  cases, the devices can likewise be unplugged at any time too.

  One well known example of this is PCMCIA- or PC-cards, credit-card
  size devices such as network cards, modems or hard drives which are
  plugged into slots found on all modern laptop computers. Another
  example, used on modern desktops as well as laptops, is USB.

  Enable HOTPLUG and KMOD, and build a modular kernel. Get 
  <ulink url="http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net">agent software</ulink>
  and install it. Then your kernel will automatically call out to a
  user mode "policy agent" (<command>/sbin/hotplug</command>) to
  load modules and set up software needed to use devices as
  you hotplug them.

   depending on where I am when I boot Linux. e.g.

<programlisting role="small">
LILO: linux LOCATION=home
</programlisting>

   Or

<programlisting role="small">
LILO: linux LOCATION=work
</programlisting>

   Or simply

<programlisting role="small">
LILO: linux
</programlisting>

   where failing to set <command>LOCATION</command> means the same as
   <command>LOCATION=home</command> (i.e. my default). Instead of typing
   <command>LOCATION=place</command> each time you boot you can add an
   entry to your <filename>/etc/lilo.conf</filename> file and use the
   append instruction. e.g.

<programlisting role="small">
# Linux bootable partition for booting Linux at home
#
image = /vmlinuz
root = /dev/hda3
label = linux
read-only
# Linux bootable partition config ends
#
# Linux bootable partition for booting Linux at work
#
image = /vmlinuz
root = /dev/hda3
label = work
read-only
append="LOCATION=work"
# Linux bootable partition config ends
</programlisting>

   With the example above you can use "linux" 
   for booting at home and "work" for booting at work.
</para>

<para>
   Armed with the facility above, you can now edit the relevant rc scripts
   to test ENVIRONMENT before running <command>ifconfig</command>, setting
   up <command>route</command> etc.

<title>Configuration of sendmail</title>

<para>
   This is the most complicated part. Having installed the
   <command>sendmail-cf</command> package, I created a file named
   <filename>/usr/lib/sendmail-cf/laptop.mc</filename>:
</para>

<para>

<programlisting role="small">

# there we send outgoing email
define(`SMART_HOST',`server1.pa.uky.edu') 

# there we send mail to users my laptop does not know

# again the domain, we want to be seen as
MASQUERADE_AS(pa.uky.edu)

HACK(use_relayto,`/etc/mail/relay_allow')
HACK(check_rcpt4)
HACK(check_relay3)
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
   This looks more complicated as it is. All it does is, that it redirectes
   outbound mail to server1 (SMART_HOST) and also mail for local users
   which are not known (LUSER_RELAY). That way, I can write email to my
   colleques without using their full email address. More important: the
   From line in my email points back to my MASQUARADE_AS domain and not
   directly to my laptop. If this where not the case, email returned with
   the <emphasis>reply</emphasis> button might not reach me. You must
   restart <command>sendmail</command> for changes to take effect. Note:
   this configuration is for Redhat 5.2 systems. You may have to change
   some details.
</para>

<para>
   Now, all what is needed is to generate the <filename>/etc/sendmail.cf
   </filename>file <command>m4 laptop.mc &gt;/etc/sendmail.cf</command> and
   to add all possible domain names my laptop should respond to in
   <filename>/etc/sendmail.cw</filename>:
</para>

<para>

<programlisting role="small">
# sendmail.cw - include all aliases for your machine here.
laptop
laptop.pa.uky.edu
128.17.18.30
guest1
guest1.somewhere.org
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
   It is important to have all aliases in this file, otherwise
   <command>sendmail</command> will not accept the mail (and will reply
   <emphasis>we don't relay</emphasis> to the sender). Finally, you must
   now test the setup by sending email, replying to mail for all possible
   configurations. Any missconfiguration can result in loss of email.
</para>

<title>Configuration for fetchmail on Laptop</title>

<para>
   One method to get the email into your machine is through
   <command>fetchmail</command>. Fetchmail periodically checks for new
   email at one or more remote mail servers. I use the following fetchmail
   configuration file (in my user home directory):
   <filename>fetchmailrc</filename>
</para>

<para>

<programlisting role="small">
set postmaster "myusername"
set daemon 900
poll pop.uky.edu with proto POP3
user "mypopusername" there with password "mypoppassword" is mylaptopusername here
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
   Fetchmail will just get the email and send it to
   <command>sendmail</command> which will it deliver into your
   <filename>/var/spool/mail/$USER</filename> file.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Forward E-Mail to the Laptop</title>

<para>
   On my work station I have the following <filename>.forward</filename>
   file:
</para>

<para>

<programlisting role="small">
me@pop.acount.edu,me@server1
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
   Here server1 is the machine where I keep my mailbox. All email is send
   to the pop account to be picked up later by my laptop (using
   <command>fetchmail</command>). However, when my laptop is connected via
   ethernet, I want my email to go directly to the laptop, instead of pop:
</para>

<para>

<programlisting role="small">
me@laptop,me@server1
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
   In both cases, a backup of my email is send to server1 (where I also can
   read it, in case I cannot get my laptop). I keep/store all email on the
   laptop. 
</para>

<para>
   Switching is done by three script files and a crontab file (on the
   workstation):

<para>
   Each time I connect the laptop to the ethernet, I have to run
   <command>forward_laptop</command>, and each time I disconnect I run
   forward_pop. In case I forget to run <command>forward_pop</command>, the
   crontab job runs it for me less then 10 minutes later. To do all that
   automatically, I change the network script files on my laptop as
   follows:
</para>

<para>
   <filename>/sbin/ifdown</filename> (this script runs, whenever a network
   device is stopped, new stuff between BEGIN and END)
</para>

<para>

<programlisting role="small">

fi
# END new stuff

ifconfig ${DEVICE} down
exec /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifdown-post $CONFIG
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
   Note, that the script checks for the value of hostname. In case, I am
   connected to a foreign ethernet, my hostname and ip-address will be
   something else, e.g. guest1.
</para>

<para>
   <filename>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-post</filename> (this

<title>Processing Incoming E-Mail with procmail</title>

<para>
   This step is completely optional. The above described sendmail
   configuration calls <command>procmail</command> for each received email,
   but you could have called <command>procmail</command> using the
   <command>.forward</command> file (see the procmail man page). Procmail
   is a handy tool to block spam and to sort incoming email. 
</para>

<para>
   You need to setup a <command>.procmailrc</command> file to use
   <command>procmail</command>. See the man page for procmail, procmailrc,
   and procmailex (examples). My setup demonstrates, how to ignore certain
   email messages and split email-collections (digest) into pieces:

<title>Email with UUCP</title>

<para>
   Another possible solution for Email is to use UUCP. This software was
   made for disconnected machines, and is by far the easiest solution if
   you have several users on your laptop (we are talking about
   <acronym>UNIX</acronym>, remember?), each with his/her own account.
</para>

<para>
   Unlike what most people think, UUCP does not need a serial
   connection: it works fine over TCP/IP, so your UUCP partner can be
   any machine on the Internet, if it is reachable from your network
   attachment point. Here is the UUCP <filename>sys</filename> for a
   typical laptop:

<programlisting role="small">

<title>MailSync</title>

<para>
   <ulink url="http://mailsync.sourceforge.net/">Mailsync</ulink>
   is a way of synchronizing a collection of mailboxes. The
   algorithm is a 3-way diff. Two mailboxes are simultaneously compared to
   a record of the state of both mailboxes at last sync. New messages and
   message deletions are propagated between the two mailboxes.  Mailsync
   can synchronize local mailbox files in many formats and remote
   mailboxes over IMAP, POP, and IMAPS.  
</para>

<!--

   OfflineIMAP is a tool to simplify email reading. It allows you to
   read the same mailbox from multiple computers and ensures that your
   changes will be automatically reflected on all computers. You can use
   various mail clients to read a single box or read mail while offline with
   full synchronization when you reconnect. You can read IMAP mail with
   readers that lack IMAP support (same goes for SSL). OfflineIMAP's
   multithreaded synchronization algorithm performs between 10 and 60 times
   faster than many mail readers' internal IMAP support, and it can be used
   even with mail readers that support IMAP already. There are five available
   user interface modules, including scripted execution, an interactive
   terminal interface, and GUI interfaces.

<title>Version Management Software</title>

<para>
   Although it is certainly not their main aim, version management software
   like CVS (Concurrent Version System) are a perfect tool when you work on
   several machines and you have trouble keeping them in sync (something
   which is often called <quote>disconnected filesystems</quote> in the
   computer science literature).  Unlike programs like
   <command>rsync</command>, which are asymmetric (one side is the master
   and its files override those of the slave), CVS accept that you make
   changes on several machines, and try afterwards to merge them.
   Asymmetric tools are good only when you can respect a strict discipline,
   when you switch from one machine to another. On the contrary, tools like
   CVS are more forgetful.
</para>

<para>
   To synchronize two or more machines (typically a desktop and a laptop),
   just choose a CVS repository somewhere on the network. It can be on one
   of the machines you want to synchronize or on a third host. Anyway, this
   machine should be easily reachable via the network and have good disks.
</para>

<para>
   Then, <command>cvs co</command> the module you want to work on, edit it,
   and <command>cvs commit</command> when you reached a synch point and are
   connected. If you made changes on both hosts, CVS will try to merge them
   (it typically succeeds automatically) or give in and ask you to resolve
   it by hand.
</para>

<para>
   The typical limits of this solution: CVS does not deal well with binary
   files, so this solution is more for users of vi or emacs than for GIMP

   System is a descendant of the Andrew File System. Like AFS, Coda
   offers location-transparent access to a shared

   collection of dedicated file servers. But Coda represents a
   substantial improvement over AFS because it offers considerably

<title>unison</title>

<para>
   <ulink url="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/">unison</ulink>
   is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and
   Windows. It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories
   to be stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host),
   modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the
   changes in each replica to the other.
   Unison was written by researchers with an eye for well-defined
   replication semantics: they were very fussy about safety, and made
   sure to handle gracefully things like premature termination etc.
   Unison is symmetric/bidirectional (unlike rsync), works fine with
   binaries (unlike cvs), and is a user-level program (unlike most
   distributed filesystems).  It also makes a reasonable attempt to
   synchronize transparently between Unix/Linux and Windows filesystems,
   which is no small feat.  Drawbacks: it does not do version control,
   and does not handle synchronization among more than 2 file trees.
   <command>unison</command> shares a number
   of features with tools such as configuration management packages
   (<command>CVS</command>, 
   <command>PRCS</command>, 
   etc.) distributed filesystems (
   <ulink url="http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/">CODA</ulink>
   , etc.)
   <emphasis>uni-directional</emphasis> mirroring utilities
   (<command>rsync</command>, etc.) and other
   synchronizers (
   Intellisync, 
   Reconcile, etc). 
   However, there are a

</para>

<para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
   <command>unison</command> runs on both MicroSoft-Windows (95, 98, NT, and 2k) and

   <ulink url="http://tuxmobil.org/feed.html">TuxMobil IPK feed</ulink>
   . Moreover,
   <command>unison</command> works <emphasis>across</emphasis> platforms,
   allowing you to synchronize a Microsoft-Windows laptop with a Unix server, for
   example.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>

   project, currently on Linux (2.2 and 2.3).  A
   primary target of development is to provide
   support for flexible replication of directories,
   with disconnected operation and a persistent
   cache.  For example, we want to make it easy to
   manage copies of home directories on multiple
   computers, and solve the laptop/desktop
   synchronization problems. On a larger scale we aim

<title>Xfiles - file tree synchronization and cross-validation</title>

<para>
   Xfiles is an interactive utility for comparing and merging one file tree
   with another over a network. It supports freeform work on several
   machines (no need to keep track of what files are changed on which
   machine). Xfiles can also be used as a cross-validating disk &lt;-&gt;
   disk backup strategy (portions of a disk may go bad at any time, with no
   simple indication of which files were affected. Cross-validate against a
   second disk before backup to make sure you aren't backing up bad data).
</para>

<para>
   A client/server program (GUI on the client) traverses a file tree and
   reports any files that are missing on the server machine, missing on the
   client machine, or different. For each such file, the file size/sizes and
   modification date(s) are shown, and a comparison (using
   <acronym>UNIX</acronym> diff) can be obtained. For files that are missing
   from one tree, <emphasis>similarly named</emphasis> files in that tree
   are reported. Inconsistent files can then be copied in either direction
   or deleted on either machine. The file trees do not need to be accessible
   via nfs. Files checksums are computed in parallel, so largely similar
   trees can be compared over a slow network link. The client and server
   processes can also be run on the same machine. File selection and
   interaction with a revision control system such as RCS can be handled by
   scripting using jpython. Requirements Java1.1 or later and JFC/Swing1.1
   are needed.

   It will then copy the file to the remote location and make the
   original read-only. When you restore and remove, the file is copied
   back and write permissions are given back. The read-only status, of
   course, makes sure you don't start editing the file again before

<title>Connections to Servers</title>

<para>
   From Dirk Janssen &lt;dirkj_AT_u.arizona.edu&gt;: Here are several good
   ways of working on your laptop from your desktop machine. If you have a
   separate desktop machine at work, you might want to use that as a
   terminal server to your laptop. This means you get the larger screen and
   the better keyboard, without having to worry about syncing files. The
   easiest way to do this is to install ssh on both sides, and ssh from
   your desktop (running X) to the laptop. Ssh will provide a secure
   connection and, crucially, a secure X connection between the two
   machines. If you type, for example, <command>emacs &amp;</command> in
   the ssh shell, emacs will start a window on your desktop machine while
   running on your laptop. 
</para>

<para>
   There are various ways in which you can make this situation more
   productive/complicated. Emacs, for one thing, can open windows (called
   frames by emacs) on separate displays by using
   <command>make-frame-on-display</command>. This way, you can have the
   same emacs displaying on your desktop and your laptop: A dual headed
   system is born. 
</para>

<para>
   For other programs, you usually have to decide at startup time on which
   screen you want them. To run them on the laptop screen, start them as
   usual. To run them on the desktop screen, start them from the ssh shell
   on the desktop or redirect their screens using the DISPLAY variable.
   Some programs also accept a <command>-display</command> option. Read the
   documentation on <command>xauth</command> on how to set this up. An easy
   way out is to find out which pseudo display ssh has created for you by
   typing <command>echo $DISPLAY</command> in the ssh shell. Assuming your
   desktop is called <command>olli</command> and your laptop
   <command>stan</command>, this will usually produce something like
   <command>stan:10</command>. This means that processes on stan (the
   laptop) display on what they think is the 10th screen of stan, which by
   some ssh magic is actually relayed (in a secure way) to the screen of
   olli.
</para>

<para>
   There are some ways in which you can dynamically move windows from one
   machine to another. A very interesting approach is taken by
   <command>xmove</command>, but this program lacks a good user interface
   (any volunteers?). Xmove creates a pseudo screen (similar to the stan:10
   that ssh creates) and windows that have their DISPLAY set to this pseudo
   screen can be moved back and forth between real screens (provided all
   screens use the same color depth).
</para>

<para>
   Alternatively, you can run an one of the several programs that open a
   <command>virtual root window</command>: A window on your desktop that
   contains other windows. It looks a lot like running an emulator. With
   these programs, you can start your processes on stan, then move all
   their windows to olli, then work for a while, and then move them back so
   you can continue working on stan. Hibernate your laptop and repeat ad
   infinitum. Check out xmx and VNC for this. 
</para>

<para>
   If this is all too complicated for you, but you like to use the two
   screens at the same time, consider at least installing x2x. This little
   tool makes it possible to move your mouse from one screen to the other,
   and the keyboard focus goes with it. To run it, you need another ssh
   going from stan (the laptop) to olli (the desktop): ie. type
   <command>ssh olli</command> in a stan xterm. Keep this shell running and
   find out which pseudo screen was created with <command>echo
   $DISPLAY</command>. This will return something like
   <command>olli:10</command> (see above for explanation). Now, type this
   in any shell on olli: <command>x2x -west -to olli:10</command> (and I
   mean, in a shell that runs on olli and displays on olli, not an ssh
   shell) This creates a little black band to on the left (west) side of
   your desktop's screen. Whenever you move the mouse over this, the mouse
   on screen olli:10 will move. Because olli:10 is just an ssh-created
   alias for the screen of stan, the mouse on your laptop will move and you
   can type there by only moving your head, not your hands.
</para>

<para>
   A note on X-security: Playing around with various screen programs is
   much easier if you issue an <command>xhost +</command> on either
   computer. But this is extremely unsafe. Do this only when you are not
   connected to any larger network. If you have everything working, spend
   some time on getting xauth to work. If you use xdm, it is usually easy.
   Otherwise, consider starting your Xserver with the same magic cookie all
   the time. This is less safe, but still pretty safe, and it means that
   you have to copy the cookies only once. Check the startup scripts
   (.xserverrc, .xinitrc, .xsession, etc) for something like
   <command>cookie="MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 `keygen`"</command> and change that
   into (invent your own cookie here): <command>cookie="MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1
   12345678901234567890abcdefabcdef"</command>

   double-sided tape instead, but glue is more permanent. So it's easy to
   return, but will look beaten and abused if these are removed. You may
   even make an engravement into the laptop cover (inside). And even better

   run an xlock, disable the apm services in a way such that they do not
   suspend the machine automatically and start a 'laptop-protection
   daemon'. When the xlock disappears, the daemon is stopped and the apm
   services are restarted (so you might use the apm services yourself).
</para>

<para>
   In the case somebody unplugs the machine while under the xlock (without
   giving the password), then the daemon would detect it and could start
   doing some preventive action, such as:
   - playing a sound with maximum volume saying "I am getting stolen".
   - this daemon could also register to a fixed local server and do a ping
   every now and then. If the ping stops before the daemon unregister to
   the server, then server then can take other actions, such as sending
   SMS message, starting a video camera, in the room, etc.  The apm
   services down would make the stealer unable to use the hot keys to

<title>Dealing with Down Times (Cron Jobs)</title>

<para>
   A cron-like program that doesn't go by time: <command>anacron</command>
   (like "anac(h)ronistic") is a periodic command scheduler. It executes
   commands at intervals specified in days. Unlike <command>cron</command>,
   it does not assume that the system is running continuously. It can
   therefore be used to control the execution of daily, weekly and monthly
   jobs (or anything with a period of n days), on systems that don't run 24
   hours a day. When installed and configured properly,
   <command>anacron</command> will make sure that the commands are run at
   the specified intervals as closely as machine-uptime permits.
</para>

<para>
   <ulink url="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/daemons/cron">hc-cron</ulink>
   is a modified version of Paul
   Vixie's widely used <command>cron</command>
   daemon. Like the original program it runs specified jobs at periodic
   intervals. However, the original <command>crond</command> relies on the
   computer running continuously, otherwise jobs will be missed. This
   problem is addressed by <command>hc-cron</command>, that is indended for
   use on <emphasis>home-computers</emphasis> that are typically turned off
   several times a day; <command>hc-cron</command> will remember the time
   when it was shut down and catch up jobs that have occurred during down
   time when it is started again.

<title>Fan</title>

<warning>

<para>
   Please make sure what you are doing, when configuring the fan. Your
   laptop may overheat and die, in case you have done something wrong.
   Just in case you want to check the fan try to cause a heavy
   CPU load, for example by issueing <command>md5sum /dev/urandom</command>.
   Now <command>top</command> will show an increased CPU load and
   the fan should began to run eventually. Note: usually you need
   to have been connected to power, otherwise the CPU might reduce
   load by itself. Also watch for the CPU temperature
   <command>acpi -bt</command> or 
   <command>cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/*</command>.

<title>IRQ Problems with ParPort Module</title>

<para>
   Sometimes the <filename>parport</filename> causes the fan to be
   always on. You may edit the <filename>/etc/modules.conf</filename>
   to cure this:

<programlisting role="small">

   The IO address and the IRQ number depend on the hardware settings
   or the BIOS configuration. Often the IRQ does not need to be given.

</para>

<para>
   Sony (pretending using a standard) uses the msdos format to store
   images as JPEG files ; so the best way to have your OS recognizing
   them is to mount the raw device like a msdos filesystem; using mount
   directly doesn't work (don't know why) but an entry in the /etc/fstab
   file allows you to mount the device correctly. i.e.: 

<programlisting role="small">
/dev/hde1    /mnt/camera    msdos     user,noauto,ro    0    0
</programlisting>

   Of course, <command>newfs</command> before <command>mount</command> works
   too, but there is nothing to see at all ;-) I think both
   <command>noauto</command> and <command>ro</command> are important flags;
   I tried without it and it didn't work. Somehow the mount I got seems
   buggy . And if <command>ro</command> is missing, the camera doesn't
   recognize back the memory stick and it needs to be msdos-formatted. 
</para>

<para>
   Appropriate to the camera documentation , both <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym>
   and <acronym>USB</acronym> port behave the same (for Mac and Windoze -
   i.e. you see a file system auto mounted) - I deduce for Linux it should
   be the same thing too, as long as the <acronym>USB</acronym> driver is
   installed. I think now that mounting <acronym>USB</acronym> raw device
   the way I did with <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> should work, but I still
   couldn't find which device to use."

<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
   There are a few reasons which might make it necessary to
   put Micorosoft DOS/Windows and Linux together on one laptop. Often the support for
   the flash ROM of <acronym>PCMCIA</acronym> cards and modems is not
   available for Linux, or you have to retrieve hardware information, which
   is not visible with Linux, due to a lack of support by some hardware
   manufacturers. I'm not sure whether these tasks can be performed under an
   emulation like DOS-EMU, WINE or VMware.

<title>DOS Tools to Repartition a Hard Disk</title>

<para>
   Often you get a preinstalled version of Microsoft-Windows on your laptop. If you
   just want to shrink the Windows partition, you need a tool to resize
   the partition. Or you can remove the partition first, repartition, then
   reinstall. Most of the following information I found at the page of 
   <ulink url="http://libweb.sonoma.edu/mike/fujitsu/">Michael Egan</ulink>
   &lt;Michael.Egan_AT_sonoma.edu&gt;.

   A well known and reliable commercial product is

<para>
   <ulink url="http://www.bootitng.com">BootitNG</ulink> is a shareware

   partitions, unlike Partition Magic, SC2000 seems to be able to work without

<para>
   With Linux you can mount any kind of DOS/Windows partition of the type
   <command>msdos</command>, <command>vfat</command> and even compressed
   drives (Drivespace, etc.). For long file names use
   <command>vfat</command> and if you like autoconversion ( a nice feature
   for text files), you may do so by using the <command>conv=auto</command>
   option. I have used this in my <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>, but
   be aware this might cause some strange behaviour sometimes, look at
   the kernel docs for further details.

   system on notebook or laptop computers and who wish to give back
   to the Linux community and help other users with those people who
   have questions, problems, or concerns about getting Linux running
   on their mobile computers. The basic idea is that volunteers can
   leave their name, e-mail address, and the brand name and model of
   the laptop or notebook computer they are familiar with and
   willing to answer questions about, and those with problems or
   questions can look up others who are willing to help.

   Repairing a laptop can be quite expensive if you don't have a
   manufacturer's warranty. Sometimes professional support is bad. But
   opening a laptop case can be difficult. Often the procedures to upgrade
   the memory and the harddisk are described in the manual. For further
   details, you should try to get the maintenance/technical manual. Just
   be extremely careful and make notes as to where each screw goes. You
   must get most of them back in the right hole or you could ruin the
   machine by damaging the system board. Also after you get all the screws
   to an assembly out (some will be hidden) the parts are usually held
   together with plastic clips molded in, so you still must exercise care
   to separate them. Sometimes you need certain tools, for instance TORX
   screw drivers or a solder kit. Good luck.

   You need at least a 386 machine (FPU not necessary) with 8 mb ram to run
   HAL91. The entire system runs in ram, so you can remove the floppy after
   booting. The kernel supports IDE hard disks and ATAPI cdrom drives.
   Supported filesystems are ext2, iso9660 and vfat, optional encryption using
   AES is possible. Limited support for ethernet cards (NE2000 only) is also
   included. Support for scsi adapters, parallel zip drive and other ethernet
   cards is possible by loading kernel modules from an optional package.

   Here are some comments and thoughts by Nat Makarevitch 
   <!--  nat_AT_makarevitch.org -->
   about a possible approach which may
   reduce the disk activity under Linux (sparing energy, especially with
   noflushd) the file Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt of the Linux sourcetree
   documents some useful features, esp. in the 
   <filename>/proc/sys/vm</filename> section.

   Under Linux 2.2 I used:

<programlisting role="small">
echo "100 5000 8 256 500 60000 60000 1884 2" &gt; /proc/sys/vm/bdflush
</programlisting>

   especially under Linux 2.4 which uses its spare time to 'pre-save' the
   less-used memory pages into the swap, increasing the disk activity
   
   I tried to figure the more adequate parameters (Linux 2.4.9, 192 MB RAM,
   Toshiba 3480 laptop)
   
   beware: some of those parameters may be dangerous or useless (I have not
   gathered serious data about the practical efficiency).  moreover do not
   forget that delaying disk writes of data is intrinsically dangerous

<programlisting role="small">
echo 99 512 32 512 0 300000 60 0 0 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/bdflush

   Some more words about
   disks spin down with <command>noflushd</command> or
   <command>hdparm</command> utilities. The objective
   is to reduce hard disk usage to minimum, because on most laptops it
   is the primary source of noise and energy consumption. The "noflushd" daemon is a
   replacement of "update" which makes buffer updates on disk only when
   some other data is being read from the disk (the behavior of "update"
   is to flush buffers every 5 seconds, and it usually generates
   constant disk activity, so that the disk never becomes idle).
   "noflushd" also sets the disk spindown time and automatically calls
   "sync" before spindown.  The syntax is something like "noflushd -n 5
   /dev/hda". Using "noflushd" may cause loss of data if some files were
   edited while the disk was parked and not sync'ed, e.g. if the power
   was suddenly lost.
</para>

<para>
   The <command>hdparm</command> utility can set the sleep time too, and also tune the
   IDE disk parameters for better performance. Make sure that the
   kernel IDE parameter "Use DMA by default when available" (section
   "Block devices") is enabled.
</para>

<para>
   However, it is not enough to enable <command>noflushd</command>
   or IDE disk sleep time to make the disk 
   effectively silent, because the system in most
   default installations is running many cron jobs, writes to log files,
   uses swap and so on. This activity is not always desirable,
   especially if the computer is standalone (not on network) and is used
   mostly by one user.  Here are some recommendations.
</para>

<para>
   First, the cron daemon and friends (anacron, atd, logrotate,
   sendmail / exim / ...) could be removed from the system if the
   services they run (such as, cleaning /tmp directories and logs,
   checking email etc.) are not needed.
</para>

<para>
   Secondly, the syslogd configuration file
   <filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename> should
   be modified to reduce the number of log files and messages
   logged, and also to have "-" signs before every file name (which
   means that the system will not have to sync the disk every time a
   message is logged).
</para>
   
<para>
   Also, it is advisable to add "mark:none;" to the "syslog" strings,
   so that the "strich strich strich MARK strich strich strich"
   messages do not get written to the log files every half an hour.
   Typical Linux installations today have too many log files for the
   home user.
</para>
   
<para>
   Finally, the disk may not go to sleep when a lot of swap space is
   in use. Type "free" and see how much swap is being used and how
   much free RAM is available. If you think there is enough free RAM
   to work without swap, or if there is a lot of swap used AND also
   a lot of free RAM, consider freeing the swap space ("su; swapoff
   -a; swapon -a") or switching the swap space off altogether ("su;
   swapoff -a"). Working without swap should be fine on systems with
   64MB or more of RAM.  (Working without swap will reduce the
   available memory, of course, and some software crashes without
   warning when it runs out of memory. But, adding swap will not
   prevent the crash resulting from some runaway memory consumuing
   software, it will only delay it, and it will make the system swap
   a lot before it happens.)
</para>

<para>
   With these changes in the system, one could get the laptop to
   work for extended periods of time with its hard disk switched
   off.
</para>

<para>
   The kernel can be configured with "Yes" to "APM Support" and
   "Enable console blanking using APM" (section "General setup").
   Then the LCD screen lamp will shut off in console mode (so not
   just the screen goes black, but also the lamp). In X mode, the
   same effect can be obtained with "xset +dpms" (enable DPMS
   function) and "xset s blank" (enable screen blanking). One can
   add these commands to the X window session or window manager
   initialization scripts.
</para>

<para>
   The computer's BIOS energy savings options (hard disk sleep
   time, video blanking time and so on) are probably not
   useful and in some cases may even cause crashes.  Therefore
   they could be disabled in the laptop's BIOS.

   All interaction with the window manager is done through

   Scientists of 
   <ulink url="http://www.reuse-computer.de/">ReUse project</ulink>
   located at the 
   <ulink url="http://tu-berlin.de/">Technical University of Berlin</ulink> recently compared the
   energy consumption of different computer types along the life cycle. The
   production of computers actually needs 535 kWh which is 10 % less than 4
   years ago. Most of the energy will be consumed while the computer is used
   for example at work for 8 hours/day. The energy consumption of new
   computers with 2,5-3 GHz processors is even in the
   stand-bye-mode still 100 Watt, whereas a 1,4 GHz PC needs 80
   Watt and a 4 year old PC only needed 60 Watt. Therefore from the
   ecological point of view it is better to buy an old computer
   that didn't need the energy for a new production and which
   consumes less electricity while it is being used.
</para>

<para>
   LCD displays need less energy than other monitors. For this reason
   laptops are the most ecological types of the compared computers. They
   need the smallest amount of energy when they are used. And 3 year old
   laptops are better than new ones since their processors need less
   energy than new ones. There is also an article in the

<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
   The NeoMagic graphics chipset series NM20xx has been popular in
   laptops build around 1996.
   For a long time this graphics chip was only supported by commercial X11 servers,
   since the middle of 1998 RedHat provided a binary X11 server
   manufactured by PrecisionInsight. Since version 3.3.3 the appropriate 
   X11 server is also available in XFree86.

   , though I have changed some minor parts. Please note: Another method to
   achieve a better resolution in text mode is the use of the framebuffer
   driver (as explained in the X-Windows chapter above). This method
   requires kernel reconfiguration (some Linux distributions include an
   appropriate kernel already) and a new entry (vga=NNN) in
   <filename>/etc/lilo.conf</filename>. In text mode it works even with
   VESA BIOSes before version 2.0, at least on the models I could test it.
   Though the SVGATextMode method could be faster (couldn't check this
   yet).
</para>

<para>
   An apparently little known fact about the Neomagic chipset NM20xx is
   that you can run text mode in 100x37 (i.e. 800x600). This text mode is
   very nice (as opposed to the 80x25 which is ugly). I tried this with a
   HP OmniBook 800 and suppose it might work with other laptops using the
   NeoMagic chip, too.
</para>

<para>
   The main problem is that is a bit difficult to set up, and if you're
   going wrong with the commands <command>SVGATextMode</command>
   or <command>restoretextmode</command> some results on the
   <acronym>LCD</acronym> might be frightening. Although I didn't manage to

<para>
   Annoying things will be displayed if you don't use the right

   (arbitrary name) to the kernel (using append=xxx in lilo.conf) when I
   also set <command>vga=7</command>: the script

   <command>restoretextmode</command> and <command>SVGATextMode</command>

Chris Hurley, Michael Puchol, Russ Rogers, Frank Thornton: WarDriving - Drive, Detect, Defend, A Guide to Wireless Security, 2004
</para>

<para>

From the Publisher: 
"Wardriving has brought some of the top people in the wireless industry
together to put together a truly informative book on what wardriving is
and the tools that should be part of any IT department's arsenal that
either has wireless or is looking to deploy it." -John Kleinschmidt,
Michiganwireless.org Founder

The practice of WarDriving is a unique combination of hobby, sociological
research, and security assessment. The act of driving or walking through
urban areas with a wireless-equipped laptop to map both protected and
un-protected wireless networks has sparked intense debate amongst
lawmakers, security professionals, and the telecommunications industry.
This first ever book on WarDriving is written from the inside perspective
of those who have created the tools that make WarDriving possible and
those who gather, analyze, and maintain data on all secured and open
wireless access points in very major, metropolitan area worldwide. These
insiders also provide the information to secure your wireless network
before it is exploited by criminal hackers.

Wireless networks have become a way of life in the past two years. As more
wireless networks are deployed the need to secure them increases. This book
educates users of wireless networks as well as those who run the networks
about the insecurities associated with wireless networking. This effort is
called WarDriving. In order to successfully WarDrive there are hardware and
software tool required. This book covers those tools, along with cost
estimates and recommendations. Since there are hundreds of possible
configurations that can be used for WarDriving, some of the most popular are
presented to help readers decide what to buy for their own WarDriving setup.

Many of the tools that a WarDriver uses are the same tools that could be used
by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a wireless network. Since this
is not the goal of a WarDriver, the methodology that users can use to
ethically WarDrive is presented. In addition, complete coverage of WarDriving
applications, such as NetStumbler, MiniStumbler; and Kismet, are covered."

Isidor Buchmann: Batteries in a Portable World - A Handbook on Rechargeable Batteries for Non-Engineers, 2001
</para>

<para>
From the Publisher: 
"Batteries in a Portable World fills a definite need for practical
information about rechargeable batteries. Quite often, performance
specifications for batteries and chargers are based on ideal
conditions. Manufacturers carry out battery tests on brand new
equipment and in a protected environment, removed from the stress of
daily use. In Batteries in a Portable World, Mr. Buchmann observes the
battery in everyday life in the hands of the common user. By reading
Batteries in a Portable World, you will acquire a better understanding
of the strengths and limitations of the battery. You will learn how to
prolong battery life; become familiar with recommended maintenance
methods and discover ways to restore a weak battery, if such a method
is available for that battery type. Knowing how to take care of your
batteries prolongs service life, improves reliability of portable
equipment and saves money. Best of all, well-performing batteries need
replacement less often, reducing the environmental concern of battery
disposal."

<title>0. PREAMBLE</title>

<para>
   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
   written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the
   effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying
   it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License
   preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their
   work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by
   others. 
</para>

<para>
   This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works
   of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
   complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
   designed for free software. 
</para>

<para>
   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
   software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
   should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software
   does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be
   used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is
   published as a printed book.  We recommend this License principally for
   works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>

<para>
   This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice
   placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the
   terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual
   or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as
   "you". 
</para>

<para>
   A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
   Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language. 
</para>

<para>
   A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
   the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
   publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
   (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
   within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a
   textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
   mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
   connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
   commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. 
</para>

<para>
   The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
   designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that
   says that the Document is released under this License. 
</para>

<para>
   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
   Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
   Document is released under this License. 
</para>

<para>
   A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
   represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
   public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
   straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
   pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
   drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
   automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
   formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
   markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification
   by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is
   called "Opaque". 
</para>

<para>
   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
   without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
   using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML
   designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include PostScript,
   PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary
   word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools
   are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by
   some word processors for output purposes only. 
</para>

<para>
   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus
   such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
   License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which
   do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the
   most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
   beginning of the body of the text.  
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>2. VERBATIM COPYING</title>

<para>
   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
   commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
   copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
   the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
   conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
   technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
   of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
   compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
   number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
   you may publicly display copies.

<title>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>

<para>
   If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
   and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
   the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
   Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the
   back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as
   the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the full
   title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may
   add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes
   limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
   Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
   copying in other respects. 
</para>

<para>
   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
   legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
   reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
   pages. 
</para>

<para>
   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
   more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
   copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
   publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
   Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
   general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
   charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter
   option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
   distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
   Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
   until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
   copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
   the public. 
</para>

<para>
   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
   Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
   them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>4. MODIFICATIONS</title>

<para>
   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
   conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
   Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
   filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
   modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
   In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: 
</para>

<para>
   A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
   should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
   Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
   original publisher of that version gives permission.
</para>

<para>
   B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
   together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document
   (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
</para>

<para>
   C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
   Version, as the publisher. 
</para>

<para>
   D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. 
</para>

<para>
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. 
</para>

<para>
   F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms
   of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. 
</para>

<para>
   G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. 
</para>

<para>
   H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. 
</para>

<para>
   I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it
   an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of
   the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
   entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
   authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then
   add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
   sentence. 
</para>

<para>
   J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
   network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
   based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a
   network location for a work that was published at least four years
   before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
   it refers to gives permission. 
</para>

<para>
   K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve
   the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and
   tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
   given therein. 
</para>

<para>
   L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
   their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are
   not considered part of the section titles. 
</para>

<para>
   M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be
   included in the Modified Version. 
</para>

<para>
   N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict
   in title with any Invariant Section. 
</para>

<para>
   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
   that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from
   the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these
   sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of
   Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These
   titles must be distinct from any other section titles. 
</para>

<para>
   You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
   nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
   parties for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
   been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
   standard. 
</para>

<para>
   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
   passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
   of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover
   Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements
   made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text
   for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by
   the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another;
   but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the
   previous publisher that added the old one. 
</para>

<para>
   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
   give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
   imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>

<para>
   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
   versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
   Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
   list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
   notice. 
</para>

<para>
   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
   multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
   copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
   different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
   at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or
   publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the
   same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections
   in the license notice of the combined work. 
</para>

<para>
   In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in
   the various original documents, forming one section entitled "History";
   likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any
   sections entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections entitled
   "Endorsements." 
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>

<para>
   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
   released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
   License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
   the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
   verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. 
</para>

<para>
   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
   it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
   License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
   other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>

<para>
   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
   independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of
   the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
   compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
   License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
   with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are
   not themselves derivative works of the Document. 
</para>

<para>
   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
   of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the
   entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers
   that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they
   must appear on covers around the whole aggregate. 
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>8. TRANSLATION</title>

<para>
   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
   translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.  Replacing
   Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
   their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
   Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
   Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License
   provided that you also include the original English version of this
   License. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the
   original English version of this License, the original English version
   will prevail. 
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>9. TERMINATION</title>

<para>
   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
   as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy,
   modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
   automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
   who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
   not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
   full compliance. 
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>

<para>
   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
   GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
   will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
   detail to address new problems or concerns. See
   http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. 
</para>

<para>
   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
   the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
   License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
   of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
   Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
   number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
   as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
