it.  The goal of this chapter will be to provide an introduction to 
the concepts of the "Open Source Community" and encourage others to 
participate in their own ways.

<title>Open Source Software</title>
<blockquote><para><quote>If you have an apple and I have an apple and we 
exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. 
But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these 
ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.</quote> G. Bernard Shaw</para>

<blockquote><para><quote>The basic idea behind open source is very simple: 
When programmers can read, redistribute, and modify the source code for a 
piece of software, the software evolves. People improve it, people adapt it, 
people fix bugs. And this can happen at a speed that, if one is used to the 
slow pace of conventional software development, seems astonishing.</quote>

<para> What does it mean to be Open Source?  Open Source means many things,
but primarily it means the sharing of ideas.  Creating something and
letting the world learn from it, use it, and change it.  Almost everything
created for Linux, including applications, documentation, and the Linux
Operating System itself are released as Open Source.  Please remember to 
share what you know and learn with others, so that we all can benefit.</para>
