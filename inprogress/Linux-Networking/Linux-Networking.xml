Nowadays people take it for granted that we exist in a world in which we are able to transfer
information and messages effortlessly and almost transparently via computers. Little thought
is given to how this is achieved. In most cases, the operating system which forms the core 
for communication on the Internet and other major computer networks are based on Unix or one 
of its variants. The reasoning behind this is mainly due to efficiency, security, and the 
tendency of people to dislike change. Hence, this document will cover the theory behind 
computer networking, as well as its use and implementation under Linux which is one of the 
more popular derivatives of Unix. It is meant to be distribution-independant and to be 
accessible to all members of the Linux community. However, a working knowledge of Linux as 
well as its CLI (Command Line Interface) is assumed. Please note that this guide is not
meant to be an all encompassing guide of networking under Linux and that little consideration
towards security is made. It was only intended to provide an overview of this subject and
provide a means by which to extend one's knowledge of networking under Linux and other
well established documents. For issues related to networking under Linux that are outside
the scope of this document please consult the Linux Documentation Project,
