		CVS	Documentation updates

2002-06-26	0.5	Adds minimal indexing support.

			Switch -v and -V, -v is now version, -V verbose.
			Ordinarily, changing options is a no-no, but I have
			few users, and the change will never cause damage.

			When table formats are set to a literal, and another
			literal is inside the column, delete the one inside.

			Fixed a bug that caused output to never be written
			to STDOUT.

2002-04-25	0.4.2	Adds support for @documentlanguage tag,
			Thanks to Jaime Irving Davila Lotorre for patch.
