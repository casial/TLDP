Dear potential LDP translators,

Most all of the LDP works can be freely translated. However, as a matter
of courtesy we ask that you first check the license of the document to
make sure this is the case AND that you kindly email the author of
the document and let him/her know that you are translating their work.

If email to the author bounces, you can either inform us, or ignore it
as some of the documents are in an unmaintained status and we have lost
track of the author.

Translated works are stored and maintained on *your own* site/server.

You can create  your own website, if you so desire. Many translatation
teams have done so (See http://www.linuxdoc.org/vlist.html#te for a
list of teams).

Translated documents are mirrored by the LDP from your server to
our main server. Your repository of information should be accessible
either through ftp or rsync to allow for us to perform the mirror
operation.

Directory structure of the repository we mirror should follow this
convention:


http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/translations/Directory-Structure

Samples of translated documents/sites we mirror:

 http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/translations/

SGML source is available through our CVS tree. You can request an
account per the following instructions:

 http://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP/LDP-Author-Guide/cvs.html

or retrieve through our web-based interface:

 http://cvsview.linuxdoc.org/

We ask that you do NOT check translated documents into this main
tree at this time, but instead store/maintain them locally with
the rest of your translation team.

There are many mailing lists that the LDP offers that you might
want to join/monitor:

 http://www.linuxdoc.org/mailinfo.html

One in particular is the "announce" list wish is used to inform
everyone when documents are updated, added, or removed from the
LDP document collection.

I hope this helps to answer some of the questions you might have.
If you have additional questions you can email myself or Guylhem
(LDP Chief coordinator/main contact - guylhem@metalab.unc.edu).

best regards,
