1. Procedure for archived docs (criteria: "those docs no longer relevant to modern linux systems")
- Docs are moved to
http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/unmaintained/
A note is added to the front page which approximately reads: 
	Archived - Last Update: YYYY-MM-DD.
	Further information can be found at: URL.

        - unmaintained the directory: archived/deleted, if not also in the
          "unmaintained list" documents are no longer relevant and should not
          be updated. Any document in this directory should be marked as, "out
          of date, reader beware."


2. Procedure for unmaintained docs
- Any document which has not been modified in more than a year should be
considered out of date. Out of date documents should be checked to see if
they are (1) unmaintained, or (2) to be archived.
- Author must be contacted to see if there is a more up-to-date version of
the document. The author should be given one to two weeks to respond.
- If the author does not respond and the document is deemed "irrelevant"
it should be either archived or removed from the collection as
appropriate.

        - unmaintained the list: out of date, but still relevant. Please help.
          If content is so desperately out of date that it is "harmful" to the
          reader, the document itself may live in "unmaintained the directory"
          until a new maintainer is found.



3. Procedure for removal
- removed for review. Document is removed from the collection and a note
is added stating: why the document was removed, what the approximate
return date is, and where people can find information about the topic in
the mean time.

removed at request of author. Document is removed from the collection (and
deleted from the CVS tree--copy will be archived in the Attic). A note
should be added to the CVS tree, and the public web site which is plain HTML 
and states:
	- the title of the document which was removed
	- why the document was removed (request of the author)
	- where readers can go to find more information about this topic.

removed because doc is just plain pathetic. Document is removed from the
collection (and deleted from the CVS tree--copy will be archived in the
Attic). A note should be added to the CVS tree, and public web site, which
is plain HTML and states: 
	- the title of the document that was removed
	- why the document was removed (e.g. did not pass Techical Review)
	- where readers can go to find more information about this topic
	- whether or not we are looking for a replacement document.

4. Procedure for new docs
See notes in the Author Guide and Reviewer HOWTO.
