CVS access can be requested from:
	www.tldp.org/cvs

Web server access must be pre-approved but can be obtained by emailing:
	help@ibiblio.org

All CVS accounts contain mappings for username@tldp.org email. This can be
configured if you have access to the ibiblio server as follows:
	- ssh into login.ibiblio.org
	- create a .forward file in your home directory
	- on the first line put in the address that you would like your email
	forwarded to. Save and close the file.
You will now receive all email sent to the ibiblio web group and to your
cvsusername@tldp.org at whatever email you set in the .forward file.
Changes will not take effect until after you've logged out.
