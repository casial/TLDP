Processing Documents for the LDP by Greg Ferguson
================================

here's my procedure. It may look complex, but it really isn't. I
simply have included all steps, so that anyone might do this, in
the event I no longer work w/the LDP. I can publish a document 
that is mailed to me in about 2 minutes, which includes saving
the attachment and copying the file from mail to the ibiblio 
server ;-)

 
1. Need an account on login.ibiblio.org. Contact the fine folks
   at ibiblio (help@ibiblio.org) to establish one.
 
2. Create a work/holding area in which to process HOWTOs, and
   make sure you have access to the CVS tree.
 
3. For HOWTOs coming in thru submit@en.tldp.org, copy (ftp/scp) up 
   to the local workarea. For those in CVS, "cvs update" the
   appropriate file(s). Example:

      bash$ cd <cvs_root>/LDP/howto/docbook
      bash$ cvs update -PCdR <files_or_directories>
 
4. If an update to an existing HOWTO, make sure the filename
   matches the existing HOWTO (document) *exactly* !! I check 
   CVS for a name match:
  
      bash$ ls <cvs_root>/LDP/howto/*/<howto>*
 
5. From the workarea, run the 'ldp_mk' script to produce all output
   formats for the HOWTO. Specify the *ML filename on cmd-line:
 
      bash$ <cvs_root>/LDP/builder/ldp_mk <howto>.xml
 
6. From the workarea, run the 'ldp_cp' script to copy the various
   output formats into their respective areas on ibiblio. Specify
   the name of the HOWTO on cmd-line.
 
      bash$ <cvs_root>/LDP/builder/ldp_cp <howto>
       
      Note...If a FAQ:
 
      bash$ LDP/builder/ldp_cp_faq <faq>
 
7. Repeat 3-6 for as many new/updated HOWTOs/documents as necessary.
 
8. Check the file(s) into the CVS archive. You'll need to have your
   *own* CVS workarea established. You can figure out where the
   file belongs in the CVS archive (LDP/howto/{linuxdoc,docbook}).
   I always do a 'cvs update' first (in the directory where the
   new/updated HOWTO will be placed). "lci" is a check-in alias I 
   use.
 
   Check-in a new file:
 
      bash$ cvs add -m <howto>.xml
      bash$ cvs commit -m "new" <howto>.xml
 
   Check-in an update to an existing file(s):
 
      bash$ lci <howto>.sgml ...
 
9. Send mail to announce@en.tldp.org. Use output from step 6 (ldp_cp).
   Copy/paste portions into an email and send it out.
      
10. Update the HOWTO-INDEX (dates - month/year) for the updated HOWTOs.
    Check those updated files in using 'lci' (another shortcut script).
 
      bash$ cd <cvs_root>/LDP/howto/docbook/HOWTO-INDEX
      bash$ grep <howto> *
      <edit/save>
      bash$ lci .  

11. Run 'ldp_index' which: 

      a. creates variants of the HOWTO-INDEX,
      b. copies it into place (ldp_mk/ldp_cp),
      c. runs the script mk_sorted_ht which creates the various 
         lists of HOWTOs, based on meta data of the content.
