Hello,

I have cleaned up the "In Progress" list on the Linux Documentation
Project web site:
   http://tldp.org/authors/inprogress.html
This list now contains only documents which have been proposed in the last
30 days, or are currently under review. If you would like to have your
document added back to the list, please email your current status to the
LDP discuss mailing list (you must be subscribed to post). For information
on how to subscribe, please read:
   http://tldp.org/LDP/LDP-Author-Guide/html/mailinglists.html

I look forward to seeing the next version of your document!
