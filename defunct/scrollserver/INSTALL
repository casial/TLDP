Installation of ScrollServer is manual right now, but not too difficult.
You should be able to work right in your cvs tree if you like, or simply
mirror the cvs tree elsewhere while you work.

You will need to create a directory named /var/cache/scrollserver/ and give
yourself full permissions to it in order to do this.

To start the server, just run ./scrollserver.py and the server will come up on
port 8000 by default.

Run `./scrollserver --help' for a list of available options.
