<h1>ScrollServer</h1>

<h2>What is ScrollServer?</h2>

ScrollServer is a <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> based http server
that provides access to a <a href="http://scrollkeeper.sourceforge.net">ScrollKeeper</a>
database with any web browser. You can use ScrollServer
to browse and search help files that are installed in the ScrollKeeper
database on your computer. Someday you will also be able to view online
ScrollServer databases.
<p>
ScrollServer is a young project that is still in early development, so many
features are not yet implemented. You should find it usable but incomplete.
<p>
Please report bugs and request features by filing them on SourceForge, or
by writing to the author at
<a href="mailto:david@lupercalia.net">david@lupercalia.net</a>.

<h2>SourceForge Site</h2>

You can download the latest release and post bug reports on the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scrollserver">SourceForge Page</a>.

<h2>Status</h2>

ScrollServer is in very early development, but it is already useful. It has
been tested on RedHat 7.1 and Debian Woody. Reports of success or failure on
other systems greatly appreciated.
<p>
I'm working towards a 1.0 release which will implement basic functionality.

<ul>
<li>It must be usable in text browsers but attractive in X.</li>
<li>It must Serve all documentation formats supported by ScrollKeeper.</li>
<li>It must provide browsing by document title or topic.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In later releases searching should be powerful but easy. It's a classic trade
off, but I'm going to try. It will probably mean writing my own DocBook-aware
search library.
<p>
There are more ambitious goals in the long term. Eventally, ScrollServers will
be able to talk to one another, and to share information with each other. One
ScrollServer will `publish' a document or five hundred, and another will
`subscribe' to the `publication'. This is mainly for the benefit of the Linux
Documentation Project and others who provide more general Linux information.
<p>
Each subscription can be left offsite or cached locally, updating the
local ScrollKeeper database. If the local ScrollServer database has a cached
copy of the document, it will be used in preference to the online copy.
<p>
Eventually a reader might be able to rate a document, and have their comments
sent to the publisher (i.e., the other ScrollServer) and also to the author of
the document, which can be extracted from the DocBook.


<h2>Downloading ScrollServer</h2>

The latest release is <a href="scrollserver-0.6.tar.bz2">version 0.6</a>.
There's been quite a few improvements,
including better cache handling, LOCALE awareness, updated stylesheets,
command line config options and other miscellaneous cleanups.

<p>
See CHANGELOG for the nitty gritty.

<p><ul>
<li><a href="scrollserver-0.5.tar.bz2">ScrollServer 0.5</a></li>
<li><a href="scrollserver-0.4.tar.bz2">ScrollServer 0.4</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>CVS</h2>

I'm not using the SourceForge CVS. ScrollServer is hosted in the
<a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP/LDP-Author-Guide/cvs.html">Linux
Documentation Project CVS</a>.

<h2>Known Bugs</h2>

Gnome specific uris such as gnome-help:foo don't work. I and the gnome-doc
people are working on a solution. It may just mean work in the xsl stylesheets.
<p>
KDE documents haven't even been looked at yet.
<p>
HTML is cached, but there is no cache management.
